   Because   ,   for   those   of   us   bent   on   living   well   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> this </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   a   vital   profession   ,   comparable   to   medicine   or   nutrition   ,   since   it   produces   prosperity   for   people </span>  .   <br> </br>
   Professionals   here   ,   no   less   than   in   those   lines   of   work   ,   aim   for   something   that   ’s   good   for   many   of   us.1   So   it   matters   that   they   act   decently   ,   with   <br> </br>
   professional   integrity   .   It   matters   that   they   do   n’t   fall   prey   to   the   temptation   to   deceive   ,   cheat   ,   or   lie   ,   just   as   it   matters   that   physicians   remain   <br> </br>
   above-board   and   refuse   to   become   charlatans   and   quacks   .   It   has   long   been   held   ,   however   ,   that   the   accumulation   of   wealth   is   not   really   a   good   pursuit   ,   only   <br> </br>
   something   instrumentally   worthwhile   .   Thomas   Aquinas   put   it   this   way   :   For   wealth   is   not   sought   except   for   the   sake   of   something   else   :   because   of   itself   it   <br> </br>
   brings   us   no   good   ,   but   only   when   we   use   it   ,   whether   for   the   support   of   the   body   ,   or   for   some   similar   purposes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Now   the   supreme   good   is   sought   for   its   own   ,   and   not   for   another   ’s   sake </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Therefore </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> wealth </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   not   man   ’s   supreme   good.2 </span>  Yet   all   this   could   be   said   as   confidently   <br> </br>
   about   health   or   education   or   science   none   of   these   are   the   supreme   good   ,   at   least   not   as   Aquinas   would   define   it   :   the   life   of   pure   contemplation   ,   following   <br> </br>
   the   example   of   Aristotle   .   Yet   they   could   ,   as   could   wealth   ,   be   constitutive   of   the   supreme   good   :   a   life   that   is   well-lived   ,   successful   and   happy   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   first   consideration   in   our   discussion   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> wealth </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   then   ,   is   how   to   carry   it   off   decently   ,   that   is   to   say   ,   business   ethics   .   These   are   the   guidelines   for   how </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> people   in   business   ought   to   act </span>  ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> morals </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> that   keep   professionals   conducting   themselves   properly   and   help   folks   resist   the   temptation   to   veer   off   into </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> malpractice </span>  .   1Of   course   one   size   does   n’t   fit   all   there   are   those   who   shun   wealth   ,   who   even   thrive   with   but   very   meager   belongings   ,   for   their   particular   ,   <br> </br>
   individual   purposes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   such   individuals   need   not   be   thwarted   in   the   slightest   by   those   who   do   pursue   wealth   ,   any   more   than   fans   of   baseball   need   to   be   thwarted   by   fans   of   tennis   <br> </br>
   or   dirt   biking   or   Gregorian   chanting   .   2   The   Morality   of   Business   Ethics   is   a   discipline   specializing   in   the   examination   of   answers   to   the   questions   “   How   <br> </br>
   should   I   act   ?   ”   or   “   What   standards   ought   I   to   use   to   guide   my   conduct   ?   ”   This   is   not   a   trouble-free   discipline   ,   by   any   means   many   prominent   thinkers   consider   <br> </br>
   it   bogus   ,   as   they   might   view   astrology   ,   mainly   because   they   deny   the   twin   supports   on   which   ethics   rests   ,   namely   ,   that   human   beings   can   make   bona   fide   <br> </br>
   choices   and   that   there   can   be   some   firm   standard   by   which   to   judge   the   choices   they   make.3   <br> </br>

  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> “   Ought   ” </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> implies   “   can   ,   ”   which   is   to   say   that   acting   on   any   answer   to   the   question   of   ethics   or   any   of   its   divisions   ,   including   business   ethics   ,   assumes   that </span>  <br> </br>

   As   already   hinted   ,   ‘   prudence   ’   in   the   modern   moral   philosophical   era   became   not   a   virtue   but   an   impulse   ,   drive   or   instinct   ,   following   Hobbes   ’s   theory   of   <br> </br>
   human   motivation   that   emerged   from   taking   the   classical   physical   model   of   how   things   move   in   nature   .   The   drive   for   self-preservation   or   <br> </br>
   selfaggrandizement   in   humans   is   but   a   manifestation   of   the   law   of   motion   concerning   momentum   .   As   far   as   its   impact   on   moral   philosophy   ,   the   Hobbesian   and   <br> </br>
   later   social   scientific   account   basically   leaves   room   for   a   much-truncated   moral   life   .   Indeed   ,   the   idea   that   a   person   can   choose   to   act   in   various   ways   ,   <br> </br>
   some   (   objectively   )   right   ,   many   quite   wrong   ,   drops   out   of   Hobbes   ’s   deterministic   picture   ,   as   it   does   out   of   that   of   B.   F.   Skinner   (   the   20th   century   <br> </br>
   behaviorist).10   The   Hobbesian   picture   ,   with   some   nuances   added   ,   became   the   basic   framework   for   the   classical   economists   ’   idea   of   why   people   acted   (   <br> </br>
   behaved   )   as   they   did   they   were   driven   to   maximize   utility   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   David   Hume   and   Adam   Smith   did   ‘   pretty   up   ’   this   notion   with   talk   of   natural   sympathy   and   such   ,   but   it   remained   for   Immanuel   Kant   to   revitalize   a   bona   fide   <br> </br>
