   6   The   Morality   of   Business   As   far   as   its   impact   on   moral   philosophy   ,   the   Hobbesian   and   later   social   scientific   account   basically   leaves   room   for   a   <br> </br>
   much-truncated   moral   life   .   Indeed   ,   the   idea   that   a   person   can   choose   to   act   in   various   ways   ,   some   (   objectively   )   right   ,   many   quite   wrong   ,   drops   out   of   <br> </br>
   Hobbes   ’s   deterministic   picture   ,   as   it   does   out   of   that   of   B.   F.   Skinner   (   the   20th   century   behaviorist).10   The   Hobbesian   picture   ,   with   some   nuances   added   ,   <br> </br>
   became   the   basic   framework   for   the   classical   economists   ’   idea   of   why   people   acted   (   behaved   )   as   they   did   they   were   driven   to   maximize   utility   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   David   Hume   and   Adam   Smith   did   ‘   pretty   up   ’   this   notion   with   talk   of   natural   sympathy   and   such   ,   but  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> it   remained   for </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Immanuel   Kant </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> to   revitalize   a   bona   fide </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> moral   point   of   view   ,   albeit   at   considerable   cost </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> In   Kant   , </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> prudence </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> retains   this   impulse   or   drive   but   balanced   by   the   notion   that   one   may   be   able   to   overcome   it   via   the   good   will   ,   which   has   noumenal   origins </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ergo   Nagel   ’s   and   many   others   ’   (   e.g.   ,   Kurt   Baier11   )   pitting   of   morality   against   prudence   (   with   the   latter   ’s   ambivalent   standing   )   .   For   example   ,   there   is </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Daniel   Dennett   ,   Elbow   Room   (   Oxford   ,   UK   :   Clarendon   Press   ,   1984   )   ,   who   tries   to   construct   a   moral   framework   within   the   boundaries   of   scientific </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> determinism   ,   but   the   idea   of   personal   responsibility   for   having   made   a   wrong   choice   that   one   could   have   avoided   making   is   effectively   lost   in   this   outlook </span>  <br> </br>

   Introduction   :   A   Brief   On   Business   Ethics   7   8   The   Morality   of   Business   The   gist   of   Smith   ’s   insight   very   influential   but   not   original   with   him   (   Gordon   ,   1975   ;   <br> </br>
   Rothbard   ,   1995   )   is   that   when   not   regimented   by   governments   or   criminals   ,   those   in   the   marketplace   will   produce   wealth   more   efficiently   than   when   their   <br> </br>
   actions   are   directed   for   them   by   others   (   such   as   a   government   that   regulates   ,   taxes   and   otherwise   interferes   with   their   commercial   judgments   and   conduct   <br> </br>
   )   .   Individuals   in   voluntary   associations   have   a   better   grasp   of   both   what   needs   to   be   and   how   it   can   be   achieved   economically   ,   and   provided   they   do   this   <br> </br>
   without   force   or   fraud   as   their   means   ,   the   result   is   most   likely   to   be   economically   and   indeed   otherwise   most   beneficial   (   which   accounts   for   such   notions   <br> </br>
   as   the   prudent   separation   of   church   and   state   ,   economy   and   state   ,   the   arts   and   state   ,   and   education   and   state   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Introduction   :   A   Brief   On   Business   Ethics   9   Three   ways   of   defending   the   value   of   markets   can   be   distinguished   :   scientistic   ,   utilitarian   and   rights-based   <br> </br>
   .   The   underlying   idea   is   still   the   same   .   As   Milton   Friedman   (   19122006   )   put   it   ,   “   .   .   .   every   individual   serves   his   own   private   interest   .   .   .   .   The   great   Saints   <br> </br>
   of   history   have   served   their   ‘   private   interest   ’   just   as   the   most   money   grubbing   miser   has   served   his   interest   .   The   private   interest   is   whatever   it   is   that   <br> </br>
   drives   an   individual   ”   (   Friedman   ,   1976   )   .   <br> </br>

   It   would   become   disassociated   from   the   methodologically   more   troublesome   fields   of   ethics   and   political   philosophy   .   It   would   not   ,   in   short   ,   have   to   <br> </br>
   grapple   with   the   problem   of   values   ,   and   could   leave   matters   to   the   causes   and   preferences   that   motivate   or   drive   human   behavior   .   10   The   Morality   of   <br> </br>
   Business   Within   social   scientific   market   theories   ,   two   stand   out   ,   namely   the   neoclassical   and   the   Austrian   schools   .   The   former   is   perhaps   the   most   <br> </br>
   firmly   established   school   ,   with   various   sub-schools   ,   including   the   public   choice   and   law   and   economics   scholars   ;   the   latter   includes   those   who   follow   <br> </br>
   the   teachings   of   Ludwig   von   Mises   (   18811973   )   and   F.   A.   Hayek   (   18991992   )   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Indeed   ,   this   is   a   problem   that   faces   any   culture   wherein   science   is   prominent   and   has   lead   to   many   momentous   and   mostly   welcome   results   .   Must   this   mean   the   <br> </br>
   dehumanization   and   demoralization   of   such   a   culture   ?   Some   kind   of   successful   rapprochement   is   needed   so   as   to   secure   a   happy   coexistence   between   science   <br> </br>
   ,   technology   and   the   moral   perspective   on   human   life   (   McCloskey   ,   1985   )   .   For   one   ,   sadly   ,   too   many   people   are   not   diligently   enough   interested   in   <br> </br>
   themselves   certainly   not   in   taking   good   care   of   themselves   ,   their   children   ,   etc   .   Too   often   they   are   quite   negligent   ,   which   makes   it   plausible   to   promote   <br> </br>
   the   idea   that   they   need   to   be   cared   for   by   others   ,   even   in   their   adulthood   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   The   idea   that   money   may   be   lent   for   interest   is   still   attacked   by   some   moral   philosophers   ,   as   if   foregoing   the   benefits   of   liquid   assets   does   not   deserve   to   <br> </br>
   be   compensated   .   Is   this   all   okay   ?   Should   we   be   ashamed   when   we   embark   upon   a   career   in   business   ?   Is   it   a   lowly   profession   akin   ,   say   ,   to   prostitution   or   being   a   <br> </br>

   thinking   to   all   facets   of   our   being   ,   not   just   to   abstract   ideas   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   need   to   succeed   as   living   ,   thinking   ,   biological   entities   ,   not   only   as   intellectuals   .   (   Of   course   ,   there   is   much   debate   on   just   what   Aristotle   meant   .   But   <br> </br>
   what   we   might   call   “   intellectualism   ”   has   been   the   most   influential   aspect   of   his   ethical   reflections   .   )   Ownership   Rights   and   Commerce   19   Furthermore   ,   <br> </br>
   when   professionals   turn   cynical   about   what   they   do   ,   they   are   n’t   going   to   be   inclined   to   worry   much   about   doing   it   properly   and   ethically   .   So   ,   in   <br> </br>
   consequence   ,   business   practices   can   suffer   .   The   usual   approach   is   to   say   that   all   that   matters   is   whether   the   law   is   obeyed   ,   regardless   of   ethics   and   <br> </br>
   decency   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   None   of   this   means   that   all   people   in   business   need   to   become   well   versed   in   the   field   of   intellectual   history   .   But   they   do   need   to   be   aware   that   sometimes   <br> </br>
   they   may   have   to   dip   into   that   field   to   consult   those   who   have   contributed   to   the   on-going   dialogue   about   the   merits   of   trade   ,   commerce   ,   finance   ,   <br> </br>

   strong   implications   for   the   way   business   is   understood   and   depicted   throughout   the   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   may   even   have   an   impact   on   how   people   in   business   are   treated   ,   whether   respected   or   held   in   contempt   ,   something   that   ,   as   we   know   ,   can   have   a   powerful   <br> </br>
   impact   on   the   lives   of   those   professionals   .   Ownership   Rights   and   Commerce   21   As   my   friend   and   fellow   philosophy   professor   Neera   K.   Badhwar   argued   in   a   <br> </br>
   well-developed   ,   complex   paper   on   the   topic   ,   commerce   is   actually   the   institution   where   much   of   our   intimate   social   life   gets   its   start   .   And   anyone   can   <br> </br>
   check   this   out   easily   enough.15   22   The   Morality   of   Business   What   the   critics   do   n’t   appreciate   is   how   well   people   can   multitask   in   life   ,   that   while   they   do   <br> </br>
   business   they   can   also   do   arts   ,   sciences   ,   education   ,   family   affairs   and   the   rest   ,   on   the   side   .   <br> </br>

   Karl   Marx   was   wrong   the   free   market   is   by   no   means   only   a   cash   nexus   ,   where   everyone   thinks   only   of   the   bottom   line   .   It   would   be   entirely   unnatural   for   human   <br> </br>
   beings   to   be   that   way   .   I   wish   here   to   take   note   of   two   interesting   aspects   of   economics   .   I   want   to   explain   them   clearly   so   that   anyone   will   be   able   to   see   their   <br> </br>
   point   and   how   they   are   actually   related   .   In   a   nutshell   ,   the   famous   calculation   problem   facing   centrally   planned   economies   (   identified   by   Ludwig   von   <br> </br>
   Mises   and   his   followers   )   and   the   famous   tragedy   of   the   commons   (   hinted   at   ,   early   on   ,   by   Thucydides   and   Aristotle   ,   and   developed   more   fully   by   Garret   Hardin   <br> </br>
   )   are   ,   in   effect   ,   two   sides   of   the   same   coin   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> One   side </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   the   description </span>  ,   while  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> other </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   the   evaluation   of   the   same   phenomenon   ,   namely   ,   the   refusal   to   recognize   private   property   rights   in   human </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> affairs </span>  .   Put   briefly   ,   here   is   the   calculation   problem   :   when   individuals   are   not   owners   of   resources   ,   they   are   not   able   to   assess   their   value   ,   and   when   <br> </br>
   resources   are   publicly   owned   ,   their   use   will   be   systematically   hasty   and   imprudent   .   As   the   1975   Nobel   Laureate   F.   A.   Hayek   explained   it   :   .   .   .   It   is   more   than   <br> </br>
   a   metaphor   to   describe   the   price   system   of   telecommunications   which   enables   individual   producers   to   watch   merely   the   movements   of   a   few   pointers   ,   as   an   <br> </br>
   engineer   might   watch   the   hands   of   a   few   dials   ,   in   order   to   adjust   their   activities   to   changes   of   which   they   may   never   know   more   than   is   reflected   in   the   price   <br> </br>
   movement.16   As   to   the   tragedy   of   the   commons   ,   here   is   how   Thucydides   explained   it   ,   many   moons   ago   :   [T]hey   devote   a   very   small   fraction   of   the   time   to   the   <br> </br>
   consideration   of   any   public   object   ,   most   of   it   to   the   prosecution   of   their   own   objects   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Meanwhile   ,   each   fancies   that   no   harm   will   come   to   his   neglect   ,   that   it   is   the   business   of   somebody   else   to   Ownership   Rights   and   Commerce   23   look   after   this   or   <br> </br>
   that   for   him   ;   and   so   ,   by   the   same   notion   being   entertained   by   all   separately   ,   the   common   cause   imperceptibly   decays.17   Here   ,   the   idea   is   that   ,   when   <br> </br>
   resources   are   owned   commonly   and   all   have   access   to   their   use   ,   they   will   be   depleted   much   faster   than   under   a   system   of   private   ownership   .   Nor   will   they   <br> </br>
   likely   be   replaced   ,   under   such   common   ownership   .   That   ’s   the   tragedy   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   No   one   is   in   a   position   to   assess   just   how   much   of   the   resources   contained   in   the   commons   available   for   us   is   available   to   any   particular   one   of   us   ,   so   as   much   as   <br> </br>
   can   be   accessed   and   used   will   ,   in   fact   ,   be   consumed   .   This   will   involve   taking   as   much   (   and   as   quickly   )   as   possible   ,   while   others   scramble   equally   hard   to   do   <br> </br>
   the   same   .   The   resulting   depletion   is   not   ,   then   ,   a   matter   of   greed   or   something   else   unreasonable   but   of   doing   the   most   that   can   be   done   so   as   to   achieve   one   ’s   <br> </br>
   very   likely   legitimate   goals   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Let   ’s   explore   the   tragedy   of   the   commons   in   concrete   terms   .   Consider   that   a   cattle   rancher   is   interested   in   supplying   his   cattle   with   as   much   feed   as   he   24   <br> </br>
   The   Morality   of   Business   can   .   It   is   not   a   matter   of   what   one   owns   or   has   obtained   via   rental   ,   but   of   the   effectiveness   of   the   scramble   .   All   the   ranchers   are   <br> </br>
   under   the   impression   that   the   commons   is   available   to   them   ,   so   they   will   all   try   as   hard   as   possible   to   obtain   as   much   as   they   can   ,   and   this   will   lead   to   a   kind   of   <br> </br>
   grabbing   from   the   commons   before   others   take   what   they   want   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> This </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> can   occur   in   the   case   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ranchers </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> using   common   grazing   fields   ,   or   special   interest   groups   and   their   lobbyists   taking   as   much   as   they   are   able   to   take   via </span>  <br> </br>

   Ownership   Rights   and   Commerce   25   Suppose   someone   described   the   game   of   golf   by   reference   to   riding   in   carts   ,   wearing   funny   pants   and   large   shirts   ,   and   <br> </br>
   occasionally   using   the   various   clubs   to   beat   one   ’s   dog   .   Would   this   be   fair   ?   Someone   who   gave   such   a   definition   of   the   game   would   probably   be   on   a   warpath   to   <br> </br>
   disparage   it   ,   not   to   explain   its   true   nature   .   Why   would   some   folks   hate   globalization   as   it   is   properly   conceived   ?   Why   would   they   be   so   eager   to   distort   its   <br> </br>
   nature   and   paint   it   in   a   bad   light   ?   So   what   might   be   some   reasons   for   disliking   bona   fide   globalization   so   much   that   it   is   then   mischaracterized   to   make   it   <br> </br>
   seem   a   menace   ?   <br> </br>

   26   The   Morality   of   Business   Of   course   ,   there   are   some   groups   wherein   such   a   practice   conflicts   with   principles   of   free   trade   :   If   your   tribe   enslaves   <br> </br>
   certain   people   ,   this   will   certainly   be   threatened   by   globalization   ,   since   slaves   experience   the   harshest   barriers   of   all   to   free   trade   .   If   the   dominant   <br> </br>
   male   citizens   in   some   country   treat   women   badly   and   wish   to   bar   them   from   economic   power   ,   this   ,   too   ,   is   going   to   be   threatened   by   freedom   of   trade   .   Ownership   <br> </br>
