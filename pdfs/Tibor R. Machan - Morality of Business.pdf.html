   Because   ,   for   those   of   us   bent   on   living   well   ,   this   is   a   vital   profession   ,   comparable   to   medicine   or   nutrition   ,   since   it   produces   prosperity   for   people   .   <br> </br>
   Professionals   here   ,   no   less   than   in   those   lines   of   work   ,   aim   for   something   that   ’s   good   for   many   of   us.1   So   it   matters   that   they   act   decently   ,   with   <br> </br>
   professional   integrity   .   It   matters   that   they   do   n’t   fall   prey   to   the   temptation   to   deceive   ,   cheat   ,   or   lie   ,   just   as   it   matters   that   physicians   remain   <br> </br>
   above-board   and   refuse   to   become   charlatans   and   quacks   .   It   has   long   been   held   ,   however   ,   that   the   accumulation   of   wealth   is   not   really   a   good   pursuit   ,   only   <br> </br>
   something   instrumentally   worthwhile   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thomas   Aquinas   put   it   this   way   :   For   wealth   is   not   sought   except   for   the   sake   of   something   else   :   because   of   itself   it   brings   us   no   good   ,   but   only   when   we   use   it   ,   <br> </br>
   whether   for   the   support   of   the   body   ,   or   for   some   similar   purposes   .   Now   the   supreme   good   is   sought   for   its   own   ,   and   not   for   another   ’s   sake   .   Therefore   wealth   is   <br> </br>
   not   man   ’s   supreme   good.2   Yet   all   this   could   be   said   as   confidently   about   health   or   education   or   science   none   of   these   are   the   supreme   good   ,   at   least   not   as   <br> </br>
   Aquinas   would   define   it   :   the   life   of   pure   contemplation   ,   following   the   example   of   Aristotle   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   they   could   ,   as   could   wealth   ,   be   constitutive   of   the   supreme   good   :   a   life   that   is   well-lived   ,   successful   and   happy   .   The   first   consideration   in   our   <br> </br>
   discussion   of   wealth   ,   then   ,   is   how   to   carry   it   off   decently   ,   that   is   to   say   ,   business   ethics   .   These   are   the   guidelines   for   how   people   in   business   ought   to   act   <br> </br>
   ,   the   morals   that   keep   professionals   conducting   themselves   properly   and   help   folks   resist   the   temptation   to   veer   off   into   malpractice   .   1Of   course   one   <br> </br>
   size   does   n’t   fit   all   there   are   those   who   shun   wealth   ,   who   even   thrive   with   but   very   meager   belongings   ,   for   their   particular   ,   individual   purposes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   such   individuals   need   not   be   thwarted   in   the   slightest   by   those   who   do   pursue   wealth   ,   any   more   than   fans   of   baseball   need   to   be   thwarted   by   fans   of   tennis   <br> </br>
   or   dirt   biking   or   Gregorian   chanting   .   2   The   Morality   of   Business   Ethics   is   a   discipline   specializing   in   the   examination   of   answers   to   the   questions   “   How   <br> </br>
   should   I   act   ?   ”   or   “   What   standards   ought   I   to   use   to   guide   my   conduct   ?   ”   This   is   not   a   trouble-free   discipline   ,   by   any   means   many   prominent   thinkers   consider   <br> </br>
   it   bogus   ,   as   they   might   view   astrology   ,   mainly   because   they   deny   the   twin   supports   on   which   ethics   rests   ,   namely   ,   that   human   beings   can   make   bona   fide   <br> </br>
   choices   and   that   there   can   be   some   firm   standard   by   which   to   judge   the   choices   they   make.3   “   Ought   ”   implies   “   can   ,   ”   which   is   to   say   that   acting   on   any   answer   to   <br> </br>
   the   question   of   ethics   or   any   of   its   divisions   ,   including   business   ethics   ,   assumes   that   we   have   both   the   freedom   to   choose   how   we   act   ,   and   certain   standards   <br> </br>
   for   acting   rightly   versus   wrongly   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Assuming   ,   for   now   ,   that   ethics   is   a   bona   fide   area   of   human   concern   ,   business   ethics   is   a   division   of   professional   ethics   ,   focusing   on   the   special   areas   of   <br> </br>
   commerce   and   the   profession   of   business   .   It   seeks   the   right   answer   to   the   question   “   How   ought   I   to   act   ,   in   my   capacity   as   a   commercial   agent   or   professional   <br> </br>
   merchant   ,   manager   ,   marketer   ,   advertiser   ,   executive   and   even   consumer   ?   ”   Unlike   the   other   major   discipline   that   looks   at   business   ,   namely   economics   ,   <br> </br>
   business   ethics   does   not   assume   that   there   are   innate   motives   driving   one   to   maximize   profits   or   utilities   or   long   term   self-interest   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Business   ethics   ,   as   any   other   look   at   human   morality   ,   takes   it   that   we   are   all   capable   of   doing   the   right   or   the   wrong   thing   and   that   we   are   n’t   naturally   <br> </br>
   driven   either   way   it   ’s   up   to   us   which   we   will   chose   .   That   ,   too   ,   is   the   assumption   underlying   criminal   law   in   most   societies   .   Given   the   nature   of   ethics   as   <br> </br>
   such   ,   it   follows   that   if   one   ’s   will   is   tyrannized   ,   regimented   ,   regulated   ,   etc   .   ,   in   the   bulk   of   one   ’s   life   ,   one   can   not   act   ethically   ,   because   then   one   is   not   <br> </br>
   making   the   decisions   as   to   how   one   will   act   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   claim   that   a   banker   or   employer   or   advertiser   ought   to   do   or   avoid   doing   such   and   such   ,   that   individual   must   be   able   to   choose   ,   and   there   must   be   some   way   of   <br> </br>
   showing   that   what   he   or   she   should   or   should   not   do   is   possible   .   Barring   that   ,   all   talk   of   ethics   ,   including   business   ethics   ,   is   just   lamentation   ,   as   when   <br> </br>
   one   complains   about   bad   or   cheers   good   weather   .   This   ,   indeed   ,   also   explains   why   such   institutions   as   slavery   and   serfdom   are   widely   seen   to   be   assaults   on   <br> </br>
   human   dignity   ,   since   they   rob   people   of   the   capacity   to   be   morally   responsible   agents.4   4To   avoid   misunderstanding   ,   this   does   n’t   mean   that   no   one   under   <br> </br>
   duress   has   any   moral   responsibilities   ,   only   that   with   increasing   duress   the   capacity   to   fulfill   those   responsibilities   diminishes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Introduction   :   A   Brief   On   Business   Ethics   3   Liberty   in   human   communities   is   secured   mainly   via   the   right   to   private   property   .   If   one   has   no   authority   to   <br> </br>
   dispose   of   one   ’s   assets   as   one   sees   fit   ,   one   is   n’t   in   charge   of   one   ’s   own   life   .   If   others   do   this   ,   by   government   regulation   or   planning   ,   or   by   criminal   <br> </br>
   intrusion   ,   one   can   not   be   responsible   for   one   ’s   conduct   ,   at   least   to   the   extent   one   is   being   regimented   .   Paternalistic   laws   treat   one   as   a   child   may   be   <br> </br>
   treated   ,   dependent   on   the   decisions   of   others   and   not   fully   responsible   for   how   one   acts   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   A   well-guarded   right   to   private   property   is   ,   then   ,   a   prerequisite   for   the   exercise   of   virtuous   conduct   in   any   sphere   but   especially   in   commerce   and   <br> </br>
   business   .   Thus   ,   arguably   ,   without   a   substantial   measure   of   capitalism   ,   there   can   not   be   any   intelligible   concern   about   business   ethics   ,   for   people   will   <br> </br>
   lack   the   choice-making   capacity   or   opportunity   that   is   a   prerequisite   of   ethics   .   Professions   are   valued   human   specializations   :   medicine   ,   law   ,   <br> </br>
   education   ,   science   ,   etc   .   ,   are   all   professions   that   fulfill   some   good   health   ,   justice   ,   rearing   of   children   ,   knowledge   ,   etc   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Is   there   any   such   good   that   we   aim   for   as   we   engage   in   commerce   ?   Is   there   a   moral   virtue   that   requires   us   to   strive   for   such   a   good   ?   Yes   ,   the   virtue   of   prudence   ,   <br> </br>
   which   requires   us   all   to   take   reasonably   good   care   of   ourselves   in   life   ,   is   just   such   a   moral   virtue   .   The   goals   to   be   supported   include   prosperity   ,   health   ,   <br> </br>
   and   knowledge   .   The   effort   to   prosper   ,   to   seek   to   profit   ,   is   part   of   what   the   moral   virtue   of   prudence   requires   from   us   .   This   assumes   that   our   overall   task   is   <br> </br>
   to   do   well   at   living   ,   to   flourish   and   succeed   as   rational   animals   here   on   Earth   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   may   be   ,   however   ,   that   our   nature   is   a   divided   one   .   We   often   assume   that   part   of   existence   is   otherworldly   ,   believing   that   to   live   rightly   means   ,   in   large   <br> </br>
   measure   ,   to   prepare   for   a   “   life   after   death   .   ”   And   then   the   virtue   of   prudence   will   require   not   only   that   we   conduct   our   lives   well   on   Earth   but   also   that   we   <br> </br>
   strive   to   live   well   in   the   hereafter   ,   to   the   extent   that   we   can   intuit   how   to   do   so   .   A   considerable   source   of   consternation   in   human   affairs   stems   from   the   <br> </br>
   attempt   to   balance   what   we   require   in   order   to   live   well   on   Earth   and   what   we   require   in   order   to   live   well   after   death   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   either   case   ,   the   moral   virtue   of   prudence   requires   us   to   be   attentive   to   our   well-being   and   to   make   an   attempt   to   flourish   .   Both   commerce   ,   for   us   all   as   <br> </br>

   4   The   Morality   of   Business   institutionalization   of   certain   dimensions   of   the   moral   virtue   of   prudence   ,   at   least   vis   --   vis   the   requirements   of   <br> </br>
   flourishing   on   Earth   or   within   the   realm   of   nature   ,   as   distinct   from   within   the   realm   of   the   supernatural   .   The   virtue   of   prudence   suffered   a   serious   <br> </br>
   demotion   when   it   was   converted   to   the   profit   motive   ,   an   innate   drive   to   promote   one   ’s   self-interest   .   In   ancient   Greek   philosophical   ethics   ,   as   well   as   in   <br> </br>
   other   traditions   of   virtue   ethics   ,   prudence   was   seen   as   living   carefully   ,   doing   what   one   ’s   good   sense   or   practical   reason   would   judge   to   be   right   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   this   tradition   has   fallen   on   hard   times   ,   what   with   the   embrace   by   modern   philosophers   such   as   Thomas   Hobbes   of   a   mechanistic   explanation   of   human   <br> </br>
   behavior   that   hardly   leaves   room   for   ethics.5   Largely   guided   by   the   Hobbesian   philosophical   and   methodological   framework   ,   early   economists   began   <br> </br>
   their   study   by   embracing   the   capitalist   system   without   any   kind   of   moral   defense   of   it   it   would   have   seemed   odd   to   champion   a   virtue   of   prudence   at   the   time   ,   <br> </br>
   given   the   modern   scientism6   that   prevailed   among   many   prominent   thinkers   .   Instead   ,   they   tended   to   defend   capitalism   for   its   hospitality   to   the   innate   ,   <br> </br>
   unavoidable   human   drive   to   seek   profit   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Capitalism   was   to   be   the   smooth   path   ,   with   minimum   friction   ,   to   selfsatisfaction   ,   the   sum   of   the   achievement   of   which   was   to   be   the   public   good  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   also </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> referred   to   as   Pareto   optimality   or   the   general   welfare   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Since   economists   ,   as   social   scientists   who   strive   to   follow   the   methods   of   the   natural   sciences   ,   avoided   the   moral   issues   ,   critics   of   capitalism   soon   <br> </br>
   cornered   the   market   on   morality   .   We   can   see   their   influence   throughout   much   of   human   history   if   we   speak   of   morality   ,   we   tend   to   think   of   actions   that   are   <br> </br>
   altruistic   thus   business   is   left   off   of   the   list   of   morally   praiseworthy   professions   such   as   education   ,   art   ,   or   science   .   In   fact   ,   however   ,   people   are   n’t   <br> </br>
   driven   to   act   prudently   we   have   ample   evidence   of   imprudence   in   human   affairs   which   can   not   be   accounted   for   by   5For   more   on   this   ,   see   John   C.   Moorehouse   ,   “   <br> </br>

   6This   is   the   idea   that   the   methods   and   assumptions   of   the   natural   sciences   ought   to   be   implemented   and   embraced   by   all   others   studies   ,   including   sociology   <br> </br>

   .   Doing   what   is   prudent   requires   a   choice   ,   as   well   as   determination   or   commitment   ,   and   some   individuals   do   not   make   that   choice   .   Indeed   ,   embarking   on   a   <br> </br>

   A   moral   philosopher   could   well   respond   to   the   above   by   asking   whether   ,   in   fact   ,   prudence   is   a   moral   virtue   at   all   .   Philosophically   informed   readers   may   be   <br> </br>
   put   in   mind   of   Thomas   Nagel   ’s   book   ,   The   Possibility   of   Altruism   ,   which   contrasts   morally   motivated   action   with   prudence   ,   defined   as   acting   in   the   in-   7I   <br> </br>

   6   The   Morality   of   Business   terests   of   one   ’s   own   future   self.9   In   the   present   discussion   ,   however   ,   a   richer   notion   of   “   prudence   ”   than   Nagel   ’s   <br> </br>
   stripped-down   version   is   being   deployed   .   As   already   hinted   ,   ‘   prudence   ’   in   the   modern   moral   philosophical   era   became   not   a   virtue   but   an   impulse   ,   drive   or   <br> </br>
   instinct   ,   following   Hobbes   ’s   theory   of   human   motivation   that   emerged   from   taking   the   classical   physical   model   of   how   things   move   in   nature   .   The   drive   for   <br> </br>
   self-preservation   or   selfaggrandizement   in   humans   is   but   a   manifestation   of   the   law   of   motion   concerning   momentum   .   <br> </br>

   As   far   as   its   impact   on   moral   philosophy   ,   the   Hobbesian   and   later   social   scientific   account   basically   leaves   room   for   a   much-truncated   moral   life   .   Indeed   <br> </br>
   ,   the   idea   that   a   person   can   choose   to   act   in   various   ways   ,   some   (   objectively   )   right   ,   many   quite   wrong   ,   drops   out   of   Hobbes   ’s   deterministic   picture   ,   as   it   <br> </br>
   does   out   of   that   of   B.   F.   Skinner   (   the   20th   century   behaviorist).10   The   Hobbesian   picture   ,   with   some   nuances   added   ,   became   the   basic   framework   for  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span>  <br> </br>

   reason   ,   the   moral   virtue   of   choosing   to   be   careful   and   to   avoid   wastefulness   ,   recklessness   ,   thoughtlessness   and   other   forms   of   neglect   toward   one   ’s   <br> </br>
