   and   background   of   the   leading   ideas   of   the   monograph   ,   and   discusses   a   few   common   misunderstandings   .   Little   space   is   devoted   to   the   more   substantial   <br> </br>
   shortcomings   of   the   monograph   (   though   Kripke   stands   by   its   major   theses   )   ,   though   in   the   preface   ,   he   explains   further   ,   in   particular   ,   the   concepts   of   <br> </br>
   modality   and   rigid   designation   .   Those   objections   touched   on   are   dealt   with   briefly   as   constrained   by   the   length   of   the   preface   hopefully   not   so   briefly   as   <br> </br>
   to   confirm   some   into   thinking   the   objections   cogent   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   preface   is   not   self-standing   and   should   be   read   by   new   readers   after   the   main   text   ,   by   way   of   background   and   clarification   .   1.2   Historical   Background   <br> </br>

   All   that   strictly   follows   from   (   ii   )   about   “   names   ”   in   natural   language   is   that   either   they   are   n’t   rigid   or   true   identities   between   them   are   necessary   .   <br> </br>
   Kripke   thinks   our   intuitive   notion   is   that   names   are   rigid   ,   but   he   had   been   led   astray   to   the   contrary   belief   by   prevailing   opinion   and   the   fact   that   there   <br> </br>
   are   obviously   contingent   identities   between   so-called   names3   .   However   ,   without   investigating   natural   language   ,   it   is   already   clear   from   (   i   )   that   the   <br> </br>
   supposition   popular   amongst   materialists   that   objects   can   be   “   contingently   identical   ”   is   false4   .   Identity   would   be   an   internal   relation   even   if   <br> </br>
   natural   language   had   no   rigid   designators   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>

   conventional   description   theory   as   an   account   of   meaning   ,   but   retained   it   momentarily   as   an   account   of   fixing   a   reference   .   See   the   Second   Lecture   ,   for   the   <br> </br>
   rejection   of   the   description   theory   for   fixing   reference   and   defining   natural   kinds   .   Kripke   pays   tribute   to   the   power   of   the   then   prevailing   ideas   ,   <br> </br>
   stemming   from   Frege   and   Russell5   .   He   admits   that   the   description   theory   of   names   has   intuitive   appeal   and   much   internal   consistency   ,   in   contrast   to   much   <br> </br>

   for   dogs   the   relevant   issue   in   deciding   the   correctness   of   (   1   )   .   Kripke   has   a   footnote   where   he   says   that   he   assumes   Russell   is   right   to   say   that   definite   <br> </br>
   descriptions   can   sometimes   be   interpreted   non-rigidly   .   Other   philosophers   claim   that   definite   descriptions   can   be   interpreted   rigidly   ,   but   Kripke   <br> </br>
   doubts   this   .   However   ,   he   does   n’t   think   his   principal   thesis   is   affected   ,   since   ,   like   Russell   ,   it   contrasts   names   with   non-rigid   descriptions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   Contemporary   Perspectives   in   the   Philosophy   of   Language   ,   Kripke   addresses   the   relation   of   rigid   definite   descriptions   to   Donnellan   ’s   referential   <br> </br>
   descriptions   ,   and   discusses   the   relation   of   these   to   the   notion   of   scope   .   For   the   rest   of   Kripke   ’s   Preface   ,   see   the   Appendix   .   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   <br> </br>
   Necessity   Notes   2   .   LECTURE   I   2.1   Introduction   The   lectures   are   informal   and   were   delivered   without   notes   .   They   have   only   been   patched   up   in   a   very   minor   way   <br> </br>
   and   preserve   their   character   as   delivered   .   The   connection   between   naming   and   necessity   will   be   developed   during   the   course   of   the   lectures   .   <br> </br>
   Contemporary   analytic   philosophy   uses   tools   involving   reference   and   necessity   ,   so   the   discussion   has   far-reaching   consequences   ,   for   instance   in   the   <br> </br>
   mind-body   problem   or   the   so-called   identity   thesis   .   This   form   of   materialism   involves   intricate   questions   of   what   is   necessary   or   contingent   in   <br> </br>
   property   identities   and   such-like   .   Kripke   will   discuss   these   issues   ,   together   with   concepts   of   substance   and   natural   kinds   ,   later   in   the   lectures   .   <br> </br>
   Kripke   will   introduce   a   different   approach   to   the   issues   though   Albritton   had   raised   the   question   of   natural   kinds   by   asking   whether   we   could   discover   <br> </br>
   whether   lemons   are   not   fruits   .   Also   ,   with   Geach   on   the   essentiality   of   origins   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   His   views   may   strike   some   at   first   sight   as   obviously   wrong   .   Kripke   ’s   favourite   example   is   of   the   contemporary   philosophical   claim   that   there   are   <br> </br>
   contingently   empty   predicates   (   ie   .   those   with   null   extensions   )   ,   and   Kripke   does   n’t   dispute   this   .   However   ,   the   standard   example   is   of   unicorns   which   we   <br> </br>
   ’ve   discovered   do   n’t   exist   ,   but   which   might   have   and   in   certain   circumstances   would   have   .   Kripke   thinks   this   is   false   ,   because   we   ca   n’t   say   under   what   <br> </br>
   circumstance   there   would   have   been   unicorns   .   Even   if   archaeologists   were   to   discover   remains   satisfying   the   characteristics   of   mythological   unicorns   <br> </br>
   ,   these   would   not   demonstrably   be   remains   of   unicorns   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Kripke   has   defended   this   view   elsewhere   and   just   mentions   it   here   as   an   example   of   his   surprising   opinions   .   2.2   Naming   Kripke   now   turns   to   his   first   topic   ,   <br> </br>
   naming   .   By   a   name   ,   Kripke   means   a   proper   name   but   not   a  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> definite </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> description </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   “   the   x   such   that   x   ”   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   He   refers   to   names   and   definite   descriptions   collectively   as   designators   .   Donnellan   has   pointed   out   that   someone   may   mistakenly   use   a   definite   <br> </br>
   description   to   refer   to   someone   who   ’s   not   the   proper   referent   of   the   description   .   The   example   given   is   “   the   man   over   there   drinking   champagne   ”   ,   when   “   the   <br> </br>
   man   over   there   ”   is   ,   in   fact   ,   drinking   water   .   Even   if   there   ’s   someone   else   in   the   room   that   does   have   a   glass   of   champagne   ,   the   speaker   intended   to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   and   in   some </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> sense   did   ) </span>  refer   to   the   man   with   water   in   his   glass   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Kripke   ,   however   ,   uses   the   term   referent   of   the   description   to   mean   the   object   uniquely   satisfying   the   conditions   of   the   description   .   Mistakes   also   arise   <br> </br>
   in   the   use   of   names   eg   .   if   two   people   mistake   the   identity   of   a   third   person   .   If   one   asks   “   what   is   Jones   doing   ”   and   the   other   says   “   raking   the   leaves   ”   ,   then   ,   if   <br> </br>
   the   distant   leaf-raker   is   ,   in   fact   ,   Smith   ,   they   are   both   in   some   sense   referring   to   Smith   even   though   they   both   use   “   Jones   ”   as   the   name   of   Jones   .   Kripke   uses   <br> </br>
   the   “   referent   ”   of   a   name   to   mean   the   thing   named   by   the   name   ,   ie   .   ,   in   this   case   ,   Jones   rather   than   Smith   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   schema   is   “   the   referent   of   ‘   X   ’   is   X   ”   ,   where   ‘   X   ’   is   replaceable   by   any   name   or   description6   .   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   Kripke   thinks   that   <br> </br>
   Donnellan   ’s   examples   are   not   relevant   to   semantics   or   truthconditions   ,   but   may   be   to   speech   acts   .   In   Kripke   ’s   sense   ,   the   referent   of   a   name   or   description   <br> </br>
   is   the   semantic   referent   the   thing   named   or   uniquely   satisfying   the   description   .   Names   are   not   ambiguous   ,   nor   are   modifications   required   to   Russell   ’s   <br> </br>
   theory   of   descriptions   .   Speakers   may   refer   to   things   other   than   the   semantic   referent   if   they   have   appropriate   false   beliefs   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   2.3   Mill   Mill   wrote   in   A   System   of   Logic   that   names   have   denotation   but   not   connotation   .   Mill   ’s   example   is   of   Dartmouth   :   even   if   the   course   of   the   river   Dart   <br> </br>
   were   to   change   ,   we   could   still   with   propriety   call   Dartmouth   “   Dartmouth   ”   ,   despite   it   no   longer   being   at   the   mouth   of   the   Dart   .   “   Dartmouth   ”   does   connote   to   <br> </br>
   some   people   ,   but   in   some   way   it   does   n’t   have   a   “   sense   ”   .   It   ’s   not   part   of   the   meaning   of   the   name   “   Dartmouth   ”   that   Dartmouth   lies   at   the   mouth   of   the   Dart   :   <br> </br>
   denying   this   does   not   lead   to   a   contradiction   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   expression   “   the   x   such   that   x   ”   is   n’t   always   a   definite   description   in   English   .   Witness   “   The   Holy   Roman   Empire   ”   or   “   The   United   Nations   ”   ,   which   are   none   <br> </br>
   of   holy   ,   Roman   ,   empire   or   united   ,   and   so   should   be   regarded   as   names   .   Kripke   is   n’t   concerned   by   doubtful   cases   ,   such   as   “   God   ”   is   this   a   name   or   a   description   ?   <br> </br>
   2.4   Frege   &   Russell   Both   Frege   and   Russell   thought   that   Mill   was   profoundly   wrong   ,   and   gave   the   alternative   account   that   names   are   simply   abbreviated   or   <br> </br>
   disguised   definite   descriptions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Frege   ’s   view   was   that   such   a   description   gives   the   sense   of   the   name   .   Kripke   points   out   that   this   is   a   simplification   of   Russell   ’s   view   because   Russell   does   <br> </br>
   n’t   think   that   most   standard   names   are   names   at   all   ,   because   they   do   abbreviate   descriptions   and   have   sense   something   that   names-proper   do   n’t   .   The   only   <br> </br>
   names   for   Russell   are   demonstratives   used   of   objects   with   which   the   reader   is   acquainted   .   So   ,   Russell   does   think   names   as  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> normally   understood </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   eg   . </span>  <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> “ </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Walter </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Scott </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ” </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span>  have   sense   in   that   we </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   2.5   Arguments   against   Mill   Kripke   thinks   the   arguments   in   favour   of   Frege   and   Russell   ,   and   against   Mill   ,   are   powerful   ,   though   he   is   suspicious   because   <br> </br>
   names   do   n’t   seem   to   be   disguised   descriptions   .   He   gives   examples   of   the   arguments   against   Mill   :   1   .   The   basic   problem   with   Mill   ’s   view   is   how   we   determine   <br> </br>
   the   referent   of   a   name   as   used   by   a   given   speaker   .   If   “   x   ”   is   just   short   for   “   the   x   such   that   uniquely   x   ”   ,   then   the   unique   x   is   the   referent   of   “  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> x </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ” </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   Kripke   uses   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> example   of   “   Joe   Doakes   ”   and   “   the   man   who   corrupted   Hadleyburg   ”   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   there   ’s   no   such   descriptive   content   to   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   the   name   ,   how   do   people   use   names   to   refer   to   things   at   all   ?   In   some   <br> </br>
   situations   we   can   point   ostensively   ,   as   for   Russell   ’s   doctrine   of   acquaintance   that   the   so-called   genuine   or   proper   names   satisfied   .   But   ,   what   do   we   do   <br> </br>
   about   “   Walter   Scott   ”   ,   to   whom   we   ca   n’t   point   ?   Our   reference   to   Walter   Scott   as   the   unique   referent   of   the   name   seems   to   be   determined   by   our   knowledge   of   him   .   <br> </br>
   Frege   and   Russell   seem   to   give   the   natural   account   of   how   reference   is   determined   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   2   .   Another   motivator   is   the   “   Hesperus   ”   “   Phosphorus   ”   problem   ,   where   we   discover   that   two   names   have   the   same   referent   and   express   this   fact   by   an   identity   <br> </br>
   statement   .   <br> </br>

   .   While   Kripke   ca   n’t   quite   see   his   way   through   all   these   questions   ,   he   ’s   certain   that   Russell   and   Frege   are   wrong   .   2.6   Quine   Kripke   mentions   Quine   ’s   <br> </br>
   proposal   for   a   reform   of   the   language   ,   such   that   in   a   “   canonical   notation   ”   a   name   such   as   “   Socrates   ”   should   be   replaced   by   a   description   “   the   Socratizer   ”   ,   “   <br> </br>
   Socratizes   ”   being   an   invented   predicate   ,   and   the   description   eliminated   by   Russell   ’s   method8   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   However   ,   he   notes   that   Quine   would   agree   that   similar   problems   to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   1   )   (   3   ) </span>  above   occur   :   namely   ,   how   is   the   extension   of   “   Socratizes   ”   determined   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   2.7   Cluster   Concept   While   many   have   abandoned   the   letter   of   Frege   and   Russell   ’s   theory   ,   they   ’ve   retained   the   spirit   in   the   form   of   a   “   cluster   concept   ”   .   <br> </br>
   Kripke   quotes   Frege   ’s   recognition   of   a   problem   where   opinions   on   the   sense   of   proper   names   can   diverge   .   For   instance   ,   someone   who   accepts   the   sense   of   “   <br> </br>
   Aristotle   ”   as   “   the   Stagirite   teacher   of   Alexander   ”   will   interpret   the   meaning   of   “   Aristotle   was   born   in   Stagira   ”   differently   from   someone   who   simply   <br> </br>
   accepts   the   sense   of   “   Aristotle   ”   as   “   Plato   ’s   disciple   and   the   teacher   of   Alexander   ”   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   is   thus   a   looseness   in   the   language   ,   with   different   people   giving   different   senses   to   names   .   Even   a   single   person   may   consider   that   any   particular   <br> </br>

   The   most   common   way   out   is   to   suggest   that   we   usually   associate   a   family   of   descriptions   with   a   proper   name   ,   as   Wittgenstein   suggests   in   Philosophical   <br> </br>
   Socratizers   are   ugly   ”   .   Does   this   relate   to   Mark   Underwood   ’s   insistence   that   “   The   present   King   of   France   is   bald   ”   equates   to   “   one   and   only   one   person   <br> </br>
   currently   kings   France   ,   and   whoever   currently   kings   France   is   bald   ”   .   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   Investigations   ,   79   ,   where   he   asks   how   much   of   <br> </br>
   what   the   Bible   attributes   to   Moses   must   be   proved   false   before   my   equation   of   “   Moses   ”   with   “   the   man   who   did   what   the   Bible   relates   of   Moses   ,   or   as   any   rate   ,   a   <br> </br>
   good   deal   of   it   ”   is   proved   false   .   <br> </br>

   Kripke   states   that   the   locus   classicus   of   this   view   ,   rather   more   plausible   as   an   analysis   of   ordinary   language   than   Frege   and   Russell   ’s   ,   is   Searle   ’s   <br> </br>
   article   Proper   Names   .   The   referent   of   a   name   is   seen   not   to   be   determined   by   a   single   description   but   by   a   cluster   or   family   .   Whatever   in   some   sense   satisfies   <br> </br>
   enough   or   most   of   the   family   is   the   referent   of   the   name   .   Kripke   will   return   later   to   this   view   ,   which   appears   to   retain   the   virtues   ,   while   escaping   the   <br> </br>
