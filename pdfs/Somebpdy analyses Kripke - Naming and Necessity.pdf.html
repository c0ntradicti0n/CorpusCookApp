   and   background   of   the   leading   ideas   of   the   monograph   ,   and   discusses   a   few   common   misunderstandings   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Little   space </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   devoted   to   the   more   substantial </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> shortcomings   of   the   monograph </span>  (   though  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripke </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> stands   by   its   major   theses   )   ,   though   in   the   preface   ,   he   explains   further   ,   in   particular   ,   the   concepts   of </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> modality   and   rigid   designation </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Those   objections   touched   on   are   dealt   with   briefly   as   constrained   by   the   length   of   the   preface   hopefully   not   so   briefly   as   to   confirm   some   into   thinking   the   <br> </br>
   objections   cogent   .   The   preface   is   not   self-standing   and   should   be   read   by   new   readers   after   the   main   text   ,   by   way   of   background   and   clarification   .   1.2   <br> </br>
   Historical   Background   When   (   prior   to   1963   )   Kripke   was   working   on   the   model   theory   of   modal   logic   (   “   possible   worlds   ”   semantics   )   ,   it   had   occurred   to   him   ,   in   <br> </br>
   agreement   with   Wiggins   ,   that   the   Leibnizian   principle   of   the   indiscernibility   of   identicals   (   ie   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   identicals   have   all   properties   in   common   (x)(y)(x   y   &   Fx   ..   Fy   )   not   to   be   confused   with   the   identity   of   indiscernibles   )   was   as   self-evident   as   the   law   of   <br> </br>
   contradiction   .   Alleged   counter-examples   involving   modal   properties   always   turned   out   to   depend   on   a   confusion   non-genuine   properties   ,   confused   <br> </br>
   scopes   ,   coincidence   between   individual   concepts   confused   with   identity   between   individuals1   .   Ignoring   the   fact   that   x   need   not   have   necessary   <br> </br>
   existence   ,   Kripke   says   it   ’s   clear   that   identity   is   an   internal2   relation   ie   .   (x)(y   )   (   x   y   x   y   )   from   (   x   )   (   x   x   )   and   Leibniz   ’s   law   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripke </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> asks   what   pairs   (   x   ,   y   )   could   act   as   counter-examples   ,   for   if   the   objects   are   distinct   ,   the   antecedent   is   false </span>  ,   while  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> if   they   are   the   same   ,   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> consequent   is   true </span>  .   If   it   ’s   true   that   “   a   b   ”   ,   then   if   “   a   ”   and   “   b   ”   are   rigid   designators   ,   it   follows   that   “   a   b   ”   is   necessarily   true   ,   while   if   they   are   not   rigid   ,   <br> </br>
   no   such   conclusion   follows   about   the   statement   “   a   b   ”   ,   even   though   the   objects   designated   by   “   a   ”   and   “   b   ”   will   be   necessarily   identical   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   yet   ,   we   are   not   committed   to   any   thesis   about   natural-language   “   names   ”   .   We   must   distinguish   three   things   :   i   .   That   identical   objects   are   necessarily   <br> </br>
   identical   ii   .   That   true   identity   statements   between   rigid   designators   are   necessary   ‘   internal   relation   ’   has   been   used   in   different   ways   ,   but   it   is   often   <br> </br>
   used   as   the   relational   analogue   of   an   essential   (   monadic   )   property   .   For   example   ,   if   a   bears   the   relation   R   to   b   ,   then   R   internally   relates   a   to   b   just   in   case   a   <br> </br>
   bears   this   relation   to   b   in   every   possible   circumstance   in   which   they   both   exist   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Relations   that   are   not   internal   ,   that   contingently   link   their   relata   (   the   things   they   relate   )   ,   are   external   .   Bill   and   Hillary   are   married   ,   but   they   might   <br> </br>
   not   have   been   ,   so   this   relation   between   them   is   external   .   By   contrast   ,   some   philosophers   have   suggested   that   the   relation   being   a   biological   parent   of   is   <br> </br>
   an   internal   relation   .   In   every   world   in   which   Bill   and   Chelsea   both   exist   ,   Bill   is   her   father   .   If   this   is   correct   ,   then   the   relational   property   ,   being   a   <br> </br>
   child   of   Bill   is   essential   to   Chelsea   ,   but   being   the   father   of   Chelsea   is   not   essential   to   Bill   (   he   and   Hillary   might   never   have   met   ,   in   which   case   they   would   <br> </br>
   not   have   had   Chelsea   )   <br> </br>

   ”   .   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   iii   .   That   identity   statements   between   what   we   call   “   names   ”   in   actual   language   are   necessary   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripke </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> claims   that </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   i   )   and   (   ii   )   are   self-evident   theses   of   philosophical   logic   independent   of   natural   language   .   They   are   related   ,   but   (   i   )   is   about   objects </span>  ,   whereas   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   ii   )   is   metalinguistic   ,   roughly   following   from   (   i   )   using   substitution   of   rigid   designators   for   universal   qualifiers   (   “   roughly   ”   ,   because   delicate   <br> </br>
   distinctions   about   rigidity   are   relevant   ,   since   the   analogous   deduction   for   non-rigid   designators   is   false   )   .   All   that   strictly   follows   from   (   ii   )   about   <br> </br>
   “   names   ”   in   natural   language   is   that   either   they   are   n’t   rigid   or   true   identities   between   them   are   necessary   .   Kripke   thinks   our   intuitive   notion   is   that   <br> </br>
   names   are   rigid   ,   but   he   had   been   led   astray   to   the   contrary   belief   by   prevailing   opinion   and   the   fact   that   there   are   obviously   contingent   identities   <br> </br>
   between   so-called   names3   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   ,   without   investigating   natural   language   ,   it   is   already   clear   from   (   i   )   that  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   supposition   popular   amongst   materialists   that   objects   can   be   “ </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> contingently   identical   ”   is   false4 </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Identity   would   be   an   internal   relation   even   if   natural   language   had   no   rigid   designators   .   Kripke   claims   that   this   confused   notion   enabled   philosophers   <br> </br>
   simultaneously   to   think   of   certain   designators   as   though   they   were   (   1   )   non-rigid   and   (   2   )   rigid   the   conflict   being   hidden   by   thinking   of   the   corresponding   <br> </br>
   objects   as   “   contingently   identical   ”   .   Kripke   felt   little   sympathy   for   this   “   dark   doctrine   ”   uniquely   identifying   properties   can   coincide   contingently   <br> </br>
   ,   but   objects   can   not   be   contingently   identical   .   In   1963   -   4   ,   Kripke   concluded   that   it   can   be   demonstrated   that   names   in   ordinary   language   are   rigid   <br> </br>
   designators   ,   and   therefore   that   identities   are   necessary   .   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> intuition   about   names   . </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> We   are   asked   to   consider   the   statement:-   (   1   ) </span>  “   Aristotle   was   fond   of   dogs   ”   To   understand   this   correctly   ,   we   need   to   understand   both   (   a   )   the   extensionally   <br> </br>

   history   .   Kripke   presumes   that   everyone   agrees   that   there   was   a   certain   man   the   philosopher   we   call   “   Aristotle   ”   such   that   (   1   )   is   true   iff   he   was   fond   of   dogs   .   <br> </br>

   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   Even   Russell   would   agree   that   this   is   simply   material   equivalence   ,   given   that   there   really   was   an   Aristotle   .   The   <br> </br>
   thesis   of   rigid   designation   (   ignoring   subtleties   such   as   possible   situations   in   which   Aristotle   would   not   have   existed   )   is   just   that   the   same   paradigm   <br> </br>
   applies   to   the   truth   conditions   of   (   1   )   as   applies   to   counterfactual   situations   .   (   1   )   describes   a   counterfactual   situation   truly   iff   the   aforementioned   <br> </br>

   2.2   Naming   Kripke   now   turns   to   his   first   topic   ,   naming   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> By   a   name   ,   Kripke   means   a   proper   name   but   not   a   definite   description   (   “   the   x   such   that   x   ”   )   .

   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Frege   ’s   view </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   that   such   a   description   gives   the   sense   of   the   name </span>  .   Kripke   points   out   that   this   is   a   simplification   of   Russell   ’s   view   because   Russell   <br> </br>
   does   n’t   think   that   most   standard   names   are   names   at   all   ,   because   they   do   abbreviate   descriptions   and   have   sense   something   that   names-proper   do   n’t   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   only   names   for </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Russell </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> are   demonstratives   used   of   objects   with   which   the   reader   is   acquainted </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   ,   Russell   does   think   names   as   normally   understood   (   eg   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> “   Walter   Scott   ”   ) </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> have   sense   in   that   we   should   be   able   to   give   a   definite   description   such   that   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> object   of   the   description   is   defined   as   the   referent   of   the   name </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> In   On   Denoting   ,   Russell   appears   to   hold   that   the   notion   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> “   sense   ” </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   illusory   since   he   eliminates   descriptions   from   his   primitive   notions7 </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   ,   Kripke   differs   from   Russell   in   two   respects   (   1   )   in   using   the   term   “   names   ”   in   the   normal   sense   ,   rather   than   Russell   ’s   “   logically   proper   names   ”   and   (   2   )   in   <br> </br>
   regarding   descriptions   and   their   abbreviations   as   having   sense   .   2.5   Arguments   against   Mill   Kripke   thinks   the   arguments   in   favour   of   Frege   and   Russell   ,   <br> </br>
   and   against   Mill   ,   are   powerful   ,   though   he   is   suspicious   because   names   do   n’t   seem   to   be   disguised   descriptions   .   He   gives   examples   of   the   arguments   against   <br> </br>
   Mill   :   1   .   The   basic   problem   with   Mill   ’s   view   is   how   we   determine   the   referent   of   a   name   as   used   by   a   given   speaker   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> If </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> “   x   ” </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   just   short   for   “   the   x   such   that   uniquely   x   ”   ,   then   the   unique   x   is   the   referent   of   “   x   ” </span>  (  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripke </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> uses   the   example   of   “   Joe   Doakes   ”   and   “   the   man   who </span>  <br> </br>

   things   at   all   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   some   situations   we   can   point   ostensively   ,   as   for   Russell   ’s   doctrine   of   acquaintance   that   the   so-called   genuine   or   proper   names   satisfied   .   But   ,   what   do   <br> </br>
   we   do   about   “   Walter   Scott   ”   ,   to   whom   we   ca   n’t   point   ?   Our   reference   to   Walter   Scott   as   the   unique   referent   of   the   name   seems   to   be   determined   by   our   knowledge   of   <br> </br>
   him   .   Frege   and   Russell   seem   to   give   the   natural   account   of   how   reference   is   determined   .   2   .   Another   motivator   is   the   “   Hesperus   ”   “   Phosphorus   ”   problem   ,   <br> </br>
   where   we   discover   that   two   names   have   the   same   referent   and   express   this   fact   by   an   identity   statement   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   While   Kripke   ca   n’t   quite   see   his   way   through   all   these   questions   ,   he   ’s   certain   that   Russell   and   Frege   are   wrong   .   2.6   Quine   Kripke   mentions   Quine   ’s   <br> </br>
   proposal   for   a   reform   of   the   language   ,   such   that   in   a   “   canonical   notation   ”   a   name   such   as   “   Socrates   ”   should   be   replaced   by   a   description   “   the   Socratizer   ”   ,   “   <br> </br>
   Socratizes   ”   being   an   invented   predicate   ,   and   the   description   eliminated   by   Russell   ’s   method8   .   As   this   is   not   a   substantive   theory   of   reference   for   names   <br> </br>
   ,   it   is   not   addressed   by   Kripke   .   However   ,   he   notes   that   Quine   would   agree   that   similar   problems   to   (   1   )   (   3   )   above   occur   :   namely   ,   how   is   the   extension   of   “   <br> </br>
   Socratizes   ”   determined   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   2.7   Cluster   Concept   While   many   have   abandoned   the   letter   of   Frege   and   Russell   ’s   theory   ,   they   ’ve   retained   the   spirit   in   the   form   of   a   “   cluster   concept   ”   .   <br> </br>
   Kripke   quotes   Frege   ’s   recognition   of   a   problem   where   opinions   on   the   sense   of   proper   names   can   diverge   .   For   instance   ,   someone   who   accepts   the   sense   of   “   <br> </br>
   Aristotle   ”   as   “   the   Stagirite   teacher   of   Alexander   ”   will   interpret   the   meaning   of   “   Aristotle   was   born   in   Stagira   ”   differently   from   someone   who   simply   <br> </br>
   accepts   the   sense   of   “   Aristotle   ”   as   “   Plato   ’s   disciple   and   the   teacher   of   Alexander   ”   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   is   thus   a   looseness   in   the   language   ,   with   different   people   giving   different   senses   to   names   .   Even   a   single   person   may   consider   that   any   particular   <br> </br>
   fact   he   knows   about   the   person   named   is   contingent   .   It   ’s   not   part   of   the   meaning   of   “   Aristotle   ”   (   part   of   the   sense   of   the   name   “   Aristotle   ”   )   that   he   taught   <br> </br>
   Alexander   ,   for   this   fact   is   something   that   could   be   found   to   be   false   .   The   most   common   way   out   is   to   suggest   that   we   usually   associate   a   family   of   <br> </br>
   descriptions   with   a   proper   name   ,   as   Wittgenstein   suggests   in   Philosophical   Socratizers   are   ugly   ”   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Does   this   relate   to   Mark   Underwood   ’s   insistence   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> “   The   present   King   of   France </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   bald   ”   equates   to   “   one   and   only   one   person   currently   kings   France </span>  ,   and   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> whoever </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> currently   kings   France </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   bald   ” </span>  .   <br> </br>

   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   Investigations   ,   79   ,   where   he   asks   how   much   of   what   the   Bible   attributes   to   Moses   must   be   proved   false   before   my   <br> </br>
   equation   of   “   Moses   ”   with   “   the   man   who   did   what   the   Bible   relates   of   Moses   ,   or   as   any   rate   ,   a   good   deal   of   it   ”   is   proved   false   .   Kripke   states   that   the   locus   <br> </br>
   classicus   of   this   view   ,   rather   more   plausible   as   an   analysis   of   ordinary   language   than   Frege   and   Russell   ’s   ,   is   Searle   ’s   article   Proper   Names   .   The   <br> </br>
   referent   of   a   name   is   seen   not   to   be   determined   by   a   single   description   but   by   a   cluster   or   family   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Whatever   in   some   sense   satisfies   enough   or   most   of   the   family   is   the   referent   of   the   name   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripke </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> will   return   later   to   this   view   ,   which   appears   to   retain   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> virtues   ,   while   escaping   the   defects   ,   of   the   FregeRussell   theory </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   are   ,   however   ,   two   ways   in   which   the   cluster   concept   (   or   even   the   single   description   theory   )   can   be   viewed   .   (   1   )   The   cluster   or   single   description   <br> </br>
   gives   the   meaning   of   the   name   :   ie   .   ,   when   someone   says   “   Walter   Scott   ”   he   means   “   the   man   such   that   such   and   such   and   such   and   such   ”   (   )   .   (   2   )   Alternatively   ,   while   <br> </br>
   the   description   does   n’t   give   the   meaning   of   the   name   ,   and   there   is   no   synonymy   involved   ,   it   determines   its   reference   .   If   ,   on   examining   the   account   of   the   <br> </br>
   descriptions   ,   we   find   them   more   appropriate   to   Salvador   Dali   ,   then   for   this   person   ,   “   Walter   Scott   ”   refers   to   Salvador   Dali   rather   than   Walter   Scott   .   <br> </br>
