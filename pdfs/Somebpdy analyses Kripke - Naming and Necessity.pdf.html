 Kripke   -   Naming&Necessity   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   The   preface   is   not   self-standing   and   should   be   <br> </br>
   read   by   new   readers   after   the   main   text   ,   by   way   of   background   and   clarification   .   (   “   possible   worlds   ”   semantics   )   ,   it   had   occurred   to   him   ,   in   agreement   with   <br> </br>
   Wiggins   ,   that   the   Leibnizian   principle   of   the   indiscernibility   of   identicals   (   ie   .   identicals   have   all   properties   in   common   ;   (x)(y)(x   y   &   Fx   ..   Fy   )   ;   not   to   <br> </br>
   be   confused   with   the   identity   of   indiscernibles   )   was   as   self-evident   as   the   law   of   contradiction   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Alleged   counter-examples   involving   modal   properties   always   turned   out   to   depend   on   a   confusion   ;   non-genuine   properties   ,   confused   scopes   ,   <br> </br>
   coincidence   between   individual   concepts   confused   with   identity   between   individuals1   .   Ignoring   the   fact   that   x   need   not   have   necessary   existence   ,   <br> </br>
   Kripke   says   it   ’s   clear   that   identity   is   an   internal2   relation   ie   .   (x)(y   )   (   x   y   x   y   )   ;   from   (   x   )   (   x   x   )   and   Leibniz   ’s   law   .   Kripke   asks   what   pairs   (   x   ,   y   )   could   act   as   <br> </br>
   counter-examples   ,   for   if   the   objects   are   distinct   ,   the   antecedent   is   false   ,   while   if   they   are   the   same   ,   the   consequent   is   true   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   it   ’s   true   that   “   a   b   ”   ,   then   if   “   a   ”   and   “   b   ”   are   rigid   designators   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> it </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> follows </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> that </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> “ </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> a </span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> b </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ” </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> necessarily </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> true </span></span>  ,   while   if   they   are   not   rigid   ,   no   such   conclusion   <br> </br>

   For   example   ,   if   a   bears   the   relation   R   to   b   ,   then   R   internally   relates   a   to   b   just   in   case   a   bears   this   relation   to   b   in   every   possible   circumstance   in   which   they   <br> </br>

   but   they   might   not   have   been   ,   so   this   relation   between   them   is   external   .   By   contrast   ,   some   philosophers   have   suggested   that   the   relation   being   a   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   See   the   Second   Lecture   ,   for   the   rejection   of   the   description   theory   for   fixing   reference   and   defining   natural   kinds   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripke </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> now   gives   a   brief   (   and   maybe </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   We   are   asked   to   consider   the   statement:-   (   1   )   “   Aristotle   was   fond   of   dogs   ”   To   understand   this   correctly   ,   we   need   to   understand   both   (   a   )   the   extensionally   <br> </br>
   correct   conditions   under   which   it   is   in   fact   true   and   (   b   )   the   conditions   under   which   it   would   partially   correctly   describe   a   counterfactual   course   of   <br> </br>
   history   .   Kripke   presumes   that   everyone   agrees   that   there   was   a   certain   man   the   philosopher   we   call   “   Aristotle   ”   such   that   (   1   )   is   true   iff   he   was   fond   of   dogs   .   <br> </br>
   contingently   identical   to   a   brain-state   .   5   But   ,   does   n’t   Kripke   have   Frege   and   Russell   wrong   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   In   contrast   ,   Russell   would   have   analysed   (   1   )   as   something   like   :   (   2   )   “   The   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   was   <br> </br>
   fond   of   dogs   ”   which   in   turn   should   be   analysed   as   :   (   3   )   “   Exactly   one   person   was   last   amongst   the   great   philosophers   of   antiquity   ,   and   any   such   person   was   fond   <br> </br>
   of   dogs   ”   Kripke   notes   that   the   actual   truth   conditions   of   (   3   )   agree   with   those   of   (   1   )   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   patched   up   in   a   very   minor   way   and   <br> </br>
   preserve   their   character   as   delivered   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   connection   between   naming   and   necessity   will   be   developed   during   the   name   but   not   a   definite   description   (   “   the   x   such   that   x   ”   )   .   He   refers   to   names   and   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   The   expression   “   the   x   such   that   x   ”   is   n’t   always   a   definite   description   in   English   .   Witness   “   The   Holy   Roman   Empire   ”   <br> </br>
   or   “   The   United   Nations   ”   ,   which   are   none   of   holy   ,   Roman   ,   empire   or   united   ,   and   so   should   be   regarded   as   names   .   Kripke   is   n’t   concerned   by   doubtful   cases   ,   such   <br> </br>
   as   “   God   ”   is   this   a   name   or   a   description   ?   alternative   account   that   names   are   simply   abbreviated   or   disguised   definite   descriptions   .   Frege   ’s   view   was   that   <br> </br>
   such   a   description   gives   the   sense   of   the   name   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   powerful   ,   though   he   is   suspicious   because   names   do   n’t   seem   to   be   disguised   descriptions   .   He   gives   examples   of   the   arguments   against   Mill   :   Saul   Kripke   <br> </br>
   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   the   name   ,   how   do   people   use   names   to   refer   to   things   at   all   ?   In   some   situations   we   can   point   ostensively   ,   as   for   Russell   ’s   <br> </br>
   doctrine   of   acquaintance   that   the   so-called   genuine   or   proper   names   satisfied   .   But   ,   what   do   we   do   about   “   Walter   Scott   ”   ,   to   whom   we   ca   n’t   point   ?   Our   <br> </br>
   reference   to   Walter   Scott   as   the   unique   referent   of   the   name   seems   to   be   determined   by   our   knowledge   of   him   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Frege   and   Russell   seem   to   give   the   natural   account   of   how   reference   is   determined   .   3   .   Finally   ,   we   can   ask   questions   of   existence   .   In   asking   whether   <br> </br>
   Aristotle   existed   ,   we   want   to   know   whether   anything   answers   to   the   properties   normally   associated   with   the   name   .   Kripke   does   n’t   think   we   mean   whether   the   <br> </br>
   thing   (   man   )   existed   ,   because   once   we   ’ve   got   the   thing   we   know   it   existed   .   While   Kripke   ca   n’t   quite   see   his   way   through   all   these   questions   ,   he   ’s   certain   <br> </br>
   that   Russell   and   Frege   are   wrong   .   “   canonical   notation   ”   a   name   such   as   “   Socrates   ”   should   be   replaced   by   a   description   “   the   Socratizer   ”   ,   “   Socratizes   <br> </br>

However   ,   <br> </br>
   he   notes   that   Quine   would   agree   that   similar   problems   to   (   1   )   (   3   )   above   occur   :   namely   ,   how   is   the   extension   of   “   Socratizes   ”   determined   .   2.7   Cluster   Concept   <br> </br>
   While   many   have   abandoned   the   letter   of   Frege   and   Russell   ’s   theory   ,   they   ’ve   Socratizers   are   ugly   ”   .   Does   this   relate   to   Mark   Underwood   ’s   insistence   that   “   <br> </br>
   The   present   King   of   France   is   bald   ”   equates   to   “   one   and   only   one   person   currently   kings   France   ,   and   whoever   currently   kings   France   is   bald   ”   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   Investigations   ,   79   ,   where   he   asks   how   much   of   what   the   Bible   attributes   to   Moses   must   be   proved   false   before   my   <br> </br>
   equation   of   “   Moses   ”   with   “   the   man   who   did   what   the   Bible   relates   of   Moses   ,   or   as   any   rate   ,   a   good   deal   of   it   ”   is   proved   false   .   Kripke   states   that   the   locus   <br> </br>
   classicus   of   this   view   ,   rather   more   plausible   as   an   analysis   of   ordinary   language   than   Frege   and   Russell   ’s   ,   is   Searle   ’s   article   Proper   Names   .   The   <br> </br>
   referent   of   a   name   is   seen   not   to   be   determined   by   a   single   description   but   by   a   cluster   or   family   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Whatever   in   some   sense   satisfies   enough   or   most   of   the   family   is   the   referent   of   the   name   .   Kripke   will   return   later   to   this   view   ,   which   appears   to   retain   the   <br> </br>
   virtues   ,   while   escaping   the   defects   ,   of   the   FregeRussell   theory   .   There   are   ,   however   ,   two   ways   in   which   the   cluster   concept   (   or   even   the   single   <br> </br>
   description   theory   )   can   be   viewed   .   (   1   )   The   cluster   or   single   description   gives   the   meaning   of   the   name   :   ie   .   ,   when   (   2   )   Alternatively   ,   while   the   <br> </br>
   description   does   n’t   give   the   meaning   of   the   name   ,   and   there   is   no   synonymy   involved   ,   it   determines   its   reference   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   ,   on   examining   the   account   of   the   descriptions   ,   we   find   them   more   appropriate   to   Salvador   Dali   ,   then   for   this   person   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> “   Walter   Scott   ” </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> refers   to   Salvador </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>

   a   theory   of   meaning   ,   as   some   of   the   solutions   to   the   problems   will   evaporate   if   the   description   does   n’t   give   the   meaning   of   the   name   .   <br> </br>

   our   name   to   rigidly   designate   (   if   the   “   such   and   such   ”   is   what   is   used   to   fix   the   reference   of   “   Moses   ”   )   .   Saul   Kripke   Naming   and   Necessity   Notes   2.21   The   <br> </br>
   Special   Case   of   Kripke   gives   another   example   of   the   distinction   between   fixing   a   reference   and   defining   one   term   as   meaning   another   .   This   is   ,   which   he   <br> </br>
   thinks   is   the   name   of   a   real   number   ,   rather   than   as   short   for   “   the   ratio   of   the   circumference   of   a   circle   to   its   diameter   ”   ,   the   number   necessarily   having   this   <br> </br>
   property   .
