 0   About   this   document   This   document   is   a   translation   of   a   large   part   of   Godel   ’s   proof   .   The   translation   happens   on   three   levels   :   from   German   to   English   Kurt   <br> </br>
   Godel   1   Introduction   [   174   ]   but   it   is   true   for   a   very   wide   class   of   formal   systems   ,   which   in   particular   includes   all   those   that   you   get   by   adding   a   finite   <br> </br>
   number   of   axioms   to   the   above   mentioned   systems   ,   provided   the   additional   axioms   do   n’t   make   false   theorems   provable   .   come   up   with   a   formula   F   (   v   )   of   PM   that   <br> </br>
   has   one   free   variable   v   (   whose   type   is   sequence   of   numbers   )   such   that   the   semantic   interpretation   of   F   (   v   )   is   :   v   is   a   provable   formula   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   will   now   construct   an   undecidable   theorem   of   the   system   PM   ,   i.e.   a   theorem   A   for   which   neither   A   nor   A   is   provable   ,   as   follows   :   class-sign   .   We   will   assume   <br> </br>
   the   class-signs   are   somehow   numbered   ,   call   the   nth   one   Rn   ,   and   note   that   both   the   concept   “   class-sign   ”   and   the   ordering   relation   R   are   definable   within   the   <br> </br>
   system   PM   .   Let   be   an   arbitrary   class-sign   ;   with   (   n   )   we   denote   the   formula   that   you   get   when   you   substitute   n   for   the   free   variable   of   .   Also   ,   the   ternary   <br> </br>
   relation   x   y(z   )   is   definable   within   PM   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Now   we   will   define   a   class   K   of   natural   numbers   as   follows   :   numbers   n   where   the   formula   Rn(n   )   that   you   get   when   you   insert   n   into   its   own   formula   Rn   is   <br> </br>
   improvable   .   Since   all   the   concepts   used   for   this   definition   are   themselves   definable   in   PM   ,   so   is   the   compound   concept   K   ,   i.e.   there   is   a   class-sign   S   such   <br> </br>
   that   the   formula   S(n   )   states   that   n   K.   As   a   class-sign   ,   S   is   identical   with   a   specific   Rq   ,   i.e.   we   have   [   176   ]   enough   to   allow   the   definition   of   the   concepts   <br> </br>
   used   above   (   in   particular   the   concept   “   provable   formula   ”   )   ,   and   in   which   on   the   other   hand   all   provable   formulae   are   also   true   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   following   exact   implementation   of   the   proof   will   among   other   things   have   the   goal   to   replace   the   second   prerequisite   by   a   purely   formal   and   much   weaker   <br> </br>
   one   .   From   the   remark   that   Rq(q   )   states   its   own   improvability   it   immediately   follows   that   Rq(q   )   is   correct   ,   since   Rq(q   )   is   in   fact   unprovable   (   because   it   is   <br> </br>
   undecidable   )   .   The   theorem   which   is   undecidable   within   the   system   PM   has   hence   been   decided   by   metamathematical   considerations   .   The   exact   analysis   of   <br> </br>
   this   strange   fact   leads   to   surprising   results   about   consistency   proofs   for   formal   systems   ,   which   will   be   discussed   in   section   4   (   theorem   XI   )   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> My   recipe </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   to   first   read   and   understand   the   whole   paper   ,   then   translate   it   one   sentence   at   a   time   (   avoid   to   start   translating   a   sentence   before   having   a </span>  <br> </br>

   it   seems   hardly   necessary   to   admit   my   strong   affection   for   type-setting   ,   and   there   is   a   certain   pleasure   in   looking   over   and   polishing   something   you   <br> </br>
   crafted   that   I   believe   I   share   with   many   people   .   A.2   Has   the   paper   improved   ?   The   original   paper   is   brilliant   ,   well-written   ,   rich   of   content   ,   relevant   .   Yet   <br> </br>
   I   went   ahead   and   tinkered   around   ,   changing   a   little   thing   here   and   there   ,   taking   much   more   freedom   than   the   translators   for   [   2   ,   1   ]   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yes   ,   the   paper   did   improve   !   It   is   closer   to   my   very   personal   ideas   of   what   it   should   ideally   look   like   .   To   me   who   did   the   changes   just   a   few   days   ago   the   modified   <br> </br>
   paper   looks   better   than   the   original   .   In   section   0   ,   I   announced   a   translation   along   three   dimensions   ,   namely   language   (   from   German   to   English   )   ,   notation   <br> </br>
   (   using   symbols   I   am   more   used   to   )   and   medium   (   exploiting   hyper-text   )   .   Let   us   review   each   one   in   turn   and   criticize   the   changes   .   Language   .   After   finishing   <br> </br>
   the   translation   ,   I   compared   it   with   the   ones   in   [   2   ,   1   ]   ,   and   found   that   although   they   are   different   ,   the   wording   probably   does   not   matter   all   that   much   .   <br> </br>
