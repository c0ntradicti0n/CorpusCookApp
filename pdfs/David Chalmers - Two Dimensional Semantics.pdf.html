   National   University   Two-dimensional   approaches   to   semantics   ,   broadly   understood   ,   recognize   two   “   dimensions   ”   of   the   meaning   or   content   of   linguistic   <br> </br>
   items   .   On   these   approaches   ,   expressions   and   their   utterances   are   associated   with   two   different   sorts   of   semantic   values   ,   which   play   different   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   In   this   broad   sense   ,   even   Frege   ’s   theory   of   sense   and   reference   might   qualify   as   a   sort   of   two-dimensional   approach   .   More   commonly   ,   two-dimensional   <br> </br>
   approaches   are   understood   more   narrowly   to   be   a   species   of   possible-worlds   semantics   ,   on   which   each   dimension   is   understood   in   terms   of   possible   worlds   <br> </br>
   and   related   modal   notions   .   In   possible-world   semantics   ,   linguistic   expressions   andor   their   utterances   are   first   associated   with   an   extension   .   The   <br> </br>
   extension   of   a   sentence   is   its   truth-value   :   for   example   ,   the   extension   of   ‘   Plato   was   a   philosopher   ’   is   true   .   The   extension   of   a   singular   term   is   its   <br> </br>
   referent   :   for   example   ,   the   extension   of   ‘   Don   Bradman   ’   is   Bradman   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   extension   of   a   general   term   is   the   class   of   individuals   that   fall   under   the   term </span>  :   <br> </br>

   .   One   can   then   associate   expressions   with   an   intension   ,   which   is   a   function   from   possible   worlds   to   extensions   .   The   intension   of   a   sentence   is   a   function   <br> </br>
   that   is   true   at   a   possible   world   if   and   only   if   the   sentence   is   true   there   :   the   intension   of   ‘   Plato   was   a   philosopher   ’   is   true   at   all   worlds   where   Plato   was   a   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   It   can   easily   happen   that   two   expressions   have   the   same   extension   but   different   intensions   .   For   example   ,   Quine   ’s   terms   ‘   cordate   ’   (   creature   with   a   heart   )   <br> </br>
   and   ‘   renate   ’   (   creature   with   a   kidney   )   pick   out   the   same   class   of   individuals   in   the   actual   world   ,   so   they   have   the   same   extension   .   But   there   are   many   <br> </br>
   possible   worlds   where   they   pick   out   different   classes   (   any   possible   world   in   which   there   are   creatures   with   hearts   but   no   kidneys   ,   for   example   )   ,   so   they   <br> </br>
   have   different   intensions   .   When   two   expressions   have   the   same   extension   and   a   different   intension   in   this   way   ,   the   difference   in   intension   usually   <br> </br>
   corresponds   to   an   intuitive   difference   in   meaning   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   it   is   natural   to   suggest   that   an   expression   ’s   intension   is   at   least   an   aspect   of   its   meaning   .   Carnap   (   1947   )   suggested   that   an   intension   behaves   in   many   <br> </br>
   respects   like   a   Fregean   sense   ,   the   aspect   of   an   expression   ’s   meaning   that   corresponds   to   its   cognitive   significance   .   For   example   ,   it   is   cognitively   <br> </br>
   significant   that   all   renates   are   cordates   and   vice   versa   (   this   was   a   nontrivial   empirical   discovery   about   the   world   )   ,   so   that   ‘   renate   ’   and   ‘   cordate   ’   <br> </br>
   should   have   different   Fregean   senses   .   One   might   naturally   suggest   that   this   difference   in   sense   is   captured   more   concretely   by   a   difference   in   intension   <br> </br>
   ,   and   that   this   pattern   generalizes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   example   ,   one   might   suppose   that   when   two   singular   terms   are   cognitively   equivalent   (   so   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ‘   ab   ’ </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   trivial   or   at   least   knowable   a   priori   ,   for   example   ) </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   then   their   extension   will   coincide   in   all   possible   worlds   ,   so   that   they   will   have   the   same   intension </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   And   one   might   suppose   that   when   two   such   terms   are   cognitively   distinct   (   so   that   ‘   ab   ’   is   knowable   only   empirically   ,   for   example   )   ,   then   their   extensions   <br> </br>
   will   differ   in   some   possible   world   ,   so   that   they   will   have   different   intensions   .   If   this   were   the   case   ,   the   distinction   between   intension   and   extension   <br> </br>
   could   be   seen   as   a   sort   of   vindication   of   a   Fregean   distinction   between   sense   and   reference   .   However   ,   the   work   of   Kripke   (   1980   )   is   widely   taken   to   show   that   <br> </br>
   no   such   vindication   is   possible   .   According   to   Kripke   ,   there   are   many   statements   that   are   knowable   only   empirically   ,   but   which   are   true   in   all   possible   <br> </br>
   worlds   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   example   ,   it   is   an   empirical   discovery   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Hesperus </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   Phosphorus </span>  ,   but  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> there   is   no   possible   world   in   which </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Hesperus </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   not   Phosphorus   (   or   vice   versa   ) </span>  ,   <br> </br>
   as   both   Hesperus   and   Phosphorus   are   identical   to   the   planet   Venus   in   all   possible   worlds   .   If   so   ,   then   ‘   Hesperus   ’   and   ‘   Phosphorus   ’   have   the   same   intension   (   <br> </br>
   one   that   picks   out   the   planet   Venus   in   all   possible   worlds   )   ,   even   though   the   two   terms   are   cognitively   distinct   .   The   same   goes   for   pairs   of   terms   such   as   ‘   <br> </br>
   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   :   it   is   an   empirical   discovery   that   water   is   H2O   ,   but   according   to   Kripke   ,   both   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   have   the   same   intension   (   picking   out   H2O   in   <br> </br>
   all   possible   worlds   )   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> Something   similar   even   applies   to   terms   such   as   ‘   I   ’   and   ‘   David   Chalmers   ’   ,   at   least   as   used   by   me   on   a   specific   occasion </span></span>  <br> </br>

If   this   is </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> correct   ,   then   intensions   are   strongly   dissociated   from   cognitive   significance </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Still   ,   there   is   a   strong   intuition   that   the   members   of   these   pairs   (   ‘   Hesperus   ’   and   ‘   Phosphorus   ’   ,   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   ,   ‘   I   ’   and   ‘   David   Chalmers   ’   )   differ   in   <br> </br>
   some   aspect   of   meaning   .   Further   ,   there   remains   a   strong   intuition   that   there   is   some   way   the   world   could   turn   out   so   that   these   terms   would   refer   to   <br> </br>
   different   things   .   For   example   ,   it   seems   to   be   at   least   epistemically   possible   (   in   some   broad   sense   )   that   these   terms   might   fail   to   corefer   .   On   the   face   of   it   <br> </br>
   ,   cognitive   differences   between   the   terms   is   connected   in   some   fashion   to   the   existence   of   these   possibilities   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   it   is   natural   to   continue   to   use   an   analysis   in   terms   of   possibility   and   necessity   to   capture   aspects   of   these   cognitive   differences   .   This   is   perhaps   the   <br> </br>
   guiding   idea   behind   two-dimensional   semantics   .   Two-dimensional   approaches   to   semantics   start   from   the   observation   that   the   extension   and   even   the   <br> </br>
   intension   of   many   of   our   expressions   depend   in   some   fashion   on   the   external   world   .   As   things   have   turned   out   ,   my   terms   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   have   the   same   <br> </br>
   extension   ,   and   have   the   same   (   Kripkean   )   intension   .   But   there   are   ways   things   could   have   turned   out   so   that   the   two   terms   could   have   had   a   different   <br> </br>
   extension   ,   and   a   different   intension   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> So   there   is   a   sense   in   which   for   a   term   like   ‘   water   ’   ,   the   term   ’s   extension   and   its </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kripkean </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> intension   depend   on   the   character   of   our   world </span>  .   <br> </br>

   i.e.   the   cells   that   correspond   to   the   same   world   considered   as   actual   and   as   counterfactual   .   In   the   example   above   :   where   the   H2O   -world   is   considered   as   <br> </br>
   actual   and   as   counterfactual   ,   then   ‘   water   ’   picks   out   H2O   ,   while   if   the   XYZ-world   is   considered   as   actual   and   as   counterfactual   ,   then   ‘   water   ’   picks   out   XYZ   <br> </br>
   .   We   can   say   that   an   expression   ’s   “   diagonal   intension   ”   is   a   function   mapping   a   world   w   to   the   term   ’s   extension   when   w   is   taken   as   both   actual   and   as   <br> </br>
   counterfactual   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> So   the   diagonal   intension   of </span>  ‘   water   ’   We   can   then   see   how   pairs   of   terms   with   the   same   extension   and   the   same   Kripkean   intension   might   nevertheless   have   <br> </br>
   different   two-dimensional   intensions   ,   and   different   diagonal   intensions   .   For   example   ,   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   have   the   same   Kripkean   intension   ,   but   it   is   <br> </br>
   plausible   that   if   the   XYZ-world   had   turned   out   to   be   actual   ,   they   would   have   had   different   Kripkean   intensions   :   ‘   water   ’   would   have   had   an   intension   that   <br> </br>
   picked   out   XYZ   in   all   worlds   ,   while  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ‘   H2O   ’ </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> still   would   have   had   an   intension   that   picked   out   H2O   in   all   worlds </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   so   ,   then   these   terms   have   different   two-   dimensional   intensions   and   different   diagonal   intensions   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> One   can   make   a   case   that   something </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> similar </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> applies </span>  <br> </br>

   perhaps   its   diagonal   intension   )   and   its   cognitive   significance   .   One   might   even   speculate   that  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> an   expression   ’s   diagonal   intension   behaves   in   some </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   At   this   point   it   must   be   acknowledged   that   things   are   not   so   simple   .   A   number   of   different   two-dimensional   approaches   to   semantics   have   been   developed   in   <br> </br>
   the   and   Jackson   (   1998   )   ,   among   others   ;   and   closely   related   two-dimensional   analysis   of   modal   notions   have   been   put   forward   by   Evans   (   1977   )   and   by   Davies   <br> </br>
   and   Humberstone   (   1981   )   .   These   approaches   differ   greatly   in   the   way   that   they   make   the   intuitive   ideas   above   precise   .   They   differ   ,   for   example   ,   in   just   <br> </br>
   what   they   take   the   “   worlds   ”   in   the   left   column   to   be   ,   and   they   differ   in   their   analysis   of   how   a   term   ’s   intension   andor   extension   depends   on   the   character   of   <br> </br>
   the   actual   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   a   result   ,   different   approaches   associate   these   terms   with   quite   different   sorts   of   two-   dimensional   semantic   values   ,   and   these   semantic   values   have   <br> </br>
   quite   different   connections   to   cognitive   significance   .   In   what   follows   ,   I   will   first   go   over   the   two-dimensional   approaches   pioneered   in   the   1970s   by   <br> </br>
   Kaplan   ,   Stalnaker   ,   Evans   ,   and   Davies   and   Humberstone.1   Each   of   these   approaches   can   be   seen   as   sharing   some   of   the   formal   structure   described   above   ,   but   <br> </br>
   with   quite   different   conceptual   underpinnings   .   Each   of   the   approaches   asserts   some   sort   of   connection   between   two-dimensional   semantic   values   and   <br> </br>
   apriority   ,   but   the   connection   is   usually   limited   in   scope   ,   applying   to   indexicals   (   Kaplan   )   and   to   descriptive   names   (   Evans   )   ,   and   ‘   actually’-involving   <br> </br>
   expressions   (   Davies   and   Humberstone   )   ,   while   Stalnaker   ’s   later   work   rejects   a   connection   to   apriority   altogether   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   will   then   describe   the   more   general   two-dimensional   approach   to   semantics   developed   in   the   1990s   by   Chalmers   ,   Jackson   ,   and   others   .   This   approach   <br> </br>
   associated   two-dimensional   semantic   values   with   expressions   of   all   kinds   ,   and   asserts   a   strong   general   connection   between   these   semantic   values   and   <br> </br>
   the   domain   of   apriority   and   cognitive   significance   .   I   will   close   by   briefly   describing   some   applications   of   the   framework   ,   and   by   considering   and   <br> </br>
   responding   to   a   number   of   objections   .   2   Early   two-dimensional   approaches   2.1   Kaplan   :   Character   and   content   Perhaps   the   best-known   broadly   <br> </br>
   two-dimensional   approach   is   Kaplan   ’s   analysis   of   the   character   and   content   of   indexicals   (   Kaplan   1979   ,   1989   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> According   to   Kaplan   ,   his   work   is   partly   grounded   in   work   in   tense   logic   by   Kamp   (   1971   )   and   Vlach   (   1973   )   ,   which   gives   a   sort   of   two-dimensional   analysis   of </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> So   the   character   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ‘ </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   am   hungry   ’   maps   the   first   context   above   to   the   proposition   that   Joe   is   hungry   at   t1   ,   and   the   second   context   above   to   the   proposition </span>  <br> </br>
   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Diana </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   hungry   at   t2 </span>  .   Extending   this   idea   to   subsentential   indexical   terms   ,   we   can   say   that   the   character   of   ‘   I   ’   maps   the   first   context   to   Joe   and   the   <br> </br>
   second   context   to   Diana   ;   more   generally   ,   it   maps   any   context   into   the   speaker   in   that   context   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Similarly   ,   the   character   of   ‘   now   ’   maps   any   context   into   the   time   specified   in   that   context   .   The   above   definition   of   character   is   still   somewhat   imprecise   <br> </br>
   ,   and   many   tricky   issues   come   up   in   giving   a   precise   definition   .   But   to   a   rough   first   approximation   ,   one   can   say   that   the   character   of   an   expression   maps   a   <br> </br>
   context   to   the   content   that   the   expression   would   have   if   uttered   in   that   context   .   There   is   more   to   say   than   this   (   especially   as   Kaplan   intends   his   analysis   <br> </br>
   to   apply   even   to   contexts   in   which   there   is   no   token   of   the   relevant   utterance   )   ,   but   this   is   enough   for   now   .   <br> </br>

   occurrences   of   ‘   this   ’   and   ‘   that   ’   will   refer   to   the   same   object   ,   but   their   characters   will   differ   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   at   least   in   these   domains   ,   character   behaves   a   little   like   a   Fregean   sense   .   This   behavior   does   not   extend   to   other   expressions   ,   however   .   For   example   ,   <br> </br>
   Kaplan   holds   that   names   refer   to   the   same   individual   in   any   context   of   utterance   .   On   this   view   ,   co-extensive   names   such   as   ‘   Mark   Twain   ’   and   ‘   Samuel   Clemens   <br> </br>
   ’   will   have   exactly   the   same   character   ,   and   an   identity   such   as   ‘   Mark   Twain   is   Samuel   Clemens   ’   will   have   a   character   that   yields   a   true   proposition   in   every   <br> </br>
   context   ,   even   though   the   identity   appears   to   be   a   posteriori   and   cognitively   significant   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Something   similar   applies   to   natural   kind   terms   such   as   ‘   water   ’   .   So   on   Kaplan   ’s   analysis   ,   names   and   natural   kind   terms   have   a   “   constant   character   ”   that   is   <br> </br>
   dissociated   from   their   cognitive   roles   .   One   can   diagnose   the   situation   by   noting   that   character   is   most   closely   tied   to   the   patterns   of   <br> </br>
   context-dependence   associated   with   an   expression   ,   rather   than   to   the   expression   ’s   cognitive   significance   .   In   the   case   of   indexicals   ,   the   patterns   of   <br> </br>
   context-   dependence   of   an   expression   are   themselves   closely   associated   with   the   expression   ’s   cognitive   significance   .   But   for   many   other   expressions   ,   <br> </br>
   such   as   names   and   natural   kind   terms   ,   cognitive   significance   is   strongly   dissociated   from   patterns   of   context-   dependence   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   The   same   goes   for   numerous   ordinary   context-dependent   expressions   ,   such   as   ‘   tall   ’   .   )   As   a   result   ,   in   the   general   case   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kaplan </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ’s   framework   is   better </span>  <br> </br>
