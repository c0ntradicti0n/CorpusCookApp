   National   University   Two-dimensional   approaches   to   semantics   ,   broadly   understood   ,   recognize   two   “   dimensions   ”   of   the   meaning   or   content   of   linguistic   <br> </br>
   items   .   On   these   approaches   ,   expressions   and   their   utterances   are   associated   with   two   different   sorts   of   semantic   values   ,   which   play   different   <br> </br>
   explanatory   roles   .   Typically   ,   one   semantic   value   is   associated   with   reference   and   ordinary   truth-conditions   ,   while   the   other   is   associated   with   the   <br> </br>
   way   that   reference   and   truth-conditions   depend   on   the   external   world   .   The   second   sort   of   semantic   value   is   often   held   to   play   a   distinctive   role   in   <br> </br>
   analyzing   matters   of   cognitive   significance   andor   context-dependence   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   this   broad   sense   ,   even   Frege   ’s   theory   of   sense   and   reference   might   qualify   as   a   sort   of   two-dimensional   approach   .   More   commonly   ,   two-dimensional   <br> </br>
   approaches   are   understood   more   narrowly   to   be   a   species   of   possible-worlds   semantics   ,   on   which   each   dimension   is   understood   in   terms   of   possible   worlds   <br> </br>
   and   related   modal   notions   .   In   possible-world   semantics   ,   linguistic   expressions   andor   their   utterances   are   first   associated   with   an   extension   .   The   <br> </br>
   extension   of   a   sentence   is   its   truth-value   :   for   example   ,   the   extension   of   ‘   Plato   was   a   philosopher   ’   is   true   .   The   extension   of   a   singular   term   is   its   <br> </br>
   referent   :   for   example   ,   the   extension   of   ‘   Don   Bradman   ’   is   Bradman   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   extension   of   a   general   term   is   the   class   of   individuals   that   fall   under   the   term   :   for   example   ,   the   extension   of   ‘   cat   ’   is   the   class   of   cats   .   Other   <br> </br>
   expressions   work   similarly   .   One   can   then   associate   expressions   with   an   intension   ,   which   is   a   function   from   possible   worlds   to   extensions   .   The   intension   <br> </br>
   of   a   sentence   is   a   function   that   is   true   at   a   possible   world   if   and   only   if   the   sentence   is   true   there   :   the   intension   of   ‘   Plato   was   a   philosopher   ’   is   true   at   all   <br> </br>
   worlds   where   Plato   was   a   philosopher   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   intension   of   a   singular   term   maps   a   possible   world   to   the   referent   of   a   term   in   that   possible   world   :   In   (  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> E.   Lepore   &   B.   Smith   ,   eds   ) </span>  Oxford   Handbook   of   the   <br> </br>
   Philosophy   of   Language   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Oxford   University   Press   ,   forthcoming   .   the   intension   of   ‘   Don   Bradman   ’   picks   out   whoever   is   Bradman   in   a   world   .   The   intension   of   a   general   term   maps   a   <br> </br>
   possible   world   to   the   class   of   individuals   that   fall   under   the   term   in   that   world   :   the   intension   of   ‘   cat   ’   maps   a   possible   world   to   the   class   of   cats   in   that   <br> </br>
   world   .   It   can   easily   happen   that   two   expressions   have   the   same   extension   but   different   intensions   .   For   example   ,   Quine   ’s   terms   ‘   cordate  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> ’ </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   creature   with   a </span>  <br> </br>

   so   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> they   have   the   same   extension </span>  <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>

   continue   to   use   an   analysis   in   terms   of   possibility   and   necessity   to   capture   aspects   of   these   cognitive   differences   .   This   is   perhaps   the   guiding   idea   <br> </br>
   behind   two-dimensional   semantics   .   Two-dimensional   approaches   to   semantics   start   from   the   observation   that   the   extension   and   even   the   intension   of   <br> </br>
   many   of   our   expressions   depend   in   some   fashion   on   the   external   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   things   have   turned   out   ,   my   terms   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   have   the   same   extension   ,   and   have  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> same </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   Kripkean   ) </span>  intension   .   <br> </br>

   which   for   a   term   like   ‘   water   ’   ,   the   term   ’s   extension   and   its   Kripkean   intension   depend   on   the   character   of   our   world   .   Given   that   this   world   is   actual   ,   it   <br> </br>
   turns   out   that   ‘   water   ’   refers   to   H2O   ,   and   its   Kripkean   intension   picks   out   Venus   in   all   possible   worlds   .   But   if   another   world   had   been   actual   (   e.g.   Putnam   ’s   <br> </br>
   Twin   Earth   world   in   which   XYZ   is   the   clear   liquid   in   the   oceans   )   ,   ‘   Hesperus   ’   might   have   referred   to   something   quite   different   (   e.g.   XYZ   )   ,   and   it   might   have   <br> </br>
   had   an   entirely   different   Kripkean   intension   (   e.g.   one   that   picks   out   XYZ   in   all   worlds   )   .   <br> </br>

   this   structure   diagramatically   as   follows   :   H2O-world   XYZ-world   This   diagram   expresses   an   aspect   of   the   two-dimensional   structure   associated   with   the   <br> </br>
   term   ‘   water   ’   .   It   is   intended   to   express   the   intuitive   idea   that   if   the   H2O   -world   turns   out   to   be   actual   (   as   it   has   )   ,   then   ‘   water   ’   will   have   a   Kripkean   <br> </br>

   two-dimensional   matrix   can   be   seen   as   a   two-dimensional   intension   :   a   function   from   ordered   pairs   of   worlds   to   extensions   .   Such   a   function   is   equivalent   <br> </br>
   to   a   function   from   worlds   to   intensions   ,   and   seen   this   way   can   be   regarded   as   capturing   the   intuitive   idea   that   a   term   ’s   intension   depends   on   the   character   <br> </br>
   of   the   actual   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   can   also   recover   the   intuitive   idea   that   a   term   ’s   extension   depends   on   the   character   of   the   actual   world   by   examining   the   “   diagonal   ”   of   this   matrix   ,   <br> </br>
   i.e.   the   cells   that   correspond   to   the   same   world   considered   as   actual   and   as   counterfactual   .   In   the   example   above   :   where   the   H2O   -world   is   considered   as   <br> </br>
   actual   and   as   counterfactual   ,   then   ‘   water   ’   picks   out   H2O   ,   while   if   the   XYZ-world   is   considered   as   actual   and   as   counterfactual   ,   then   ‘   water   ’   picks   out   XYZ   <br> </br>
   .   We   can   say   that   an   expression   ’s   “   diagonal   intension   ”   is   a   function   mapping   a   world   w   to   the   term   ’s   extension   when   w   is   taken   as   both   actual   and   as   <br> </br>
   counterfactual   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   the   diagonal   intension   of   ‘   water   ’   We   can   then   see   how   pairs   of   terms   with   the   same   extension   and   the   same   Kripkean   intension   might   nevertheless   have   <br> </br>
   different   two-dimensional   intensions   ,   and   different   diagonal   intensions   .   For   example   ,   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   have   the   same   Kripkean   intension   ,   but   it   is   <br> </br>
   plausible   that   if   the   XYZ-world   had   turned   out   to   be   actual   ,   they   would   have   had   different   Kripkean   intensions   :   ‘   water   ’   would   have   had   an   intension   that   <br> </br>
   picked   out   XYZ   in   all   worlds   ,   while   ‘   H2O   ’   still   would   have   had   an   intension   that   picked   out   H2O   in   all   worlds   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   so   ,   then   these   terms   have   different   two-   dimensional   intensions   and   different   diagonal   intensions   .   One   can   make   a   case   that   something   similar   applies   <br> </br>
   with   ‘   Hesperus   ’   and   ‘   Phosphorus   ’   ,   and   with   ‘   I   ’   and   ‘   David   Chalmers   ’   :   the   members   of   each   pair   have   a   different   two-dimensional   intension   and   a   different   <br> </br>
   diagonal   intension   .   If   so   ,   then   this   begins   to   suggest   that   there   is   some   sort   of   connection   between  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> an </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> expression </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ’s   two-   dimensional   intension   (   or </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   These   approaches   differ   greatly   in   the   way   that   they   make   the   intuitive   ideas   above   precise   .   They   differ   ,   for   example   ,   in   just   what   they   take   the   “   worlds   ”   <br> </br>
   in   the   left   column   to   be   ,   and   they   differ   in   their   analysis   of   how   a   term   ’s   intension   andor   extension   depends   on   the   character   of   the   actual   world   .   As   a   result   <br> </br>
   ,   different   approaches   associate   these   terms   with   quite   different   sorts   of   two-   dimensional   semantic   values   ,   and   these   semantic   values   have   quite   <br> </br>
   different   connections   to   cognitive   significance   .   In   what   follows   ,   I   will   first   go   over   the   two-dimensional   approaches   pioneered   in   the   1970s   by   Kaplan   ,   <br> </br>
   Stalnaker   ,   Evans   ,   and   Davies   and   Humberstone.1   Each   of   these   approaches   can   be   seen   as   sharing   some   of   the   formal   structure   described   above   ,   but   with   <br> </br>
   quite   different   conceptual   underpinnings   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Each   of   the   approaches   asserts   some   sort   of   connection   between   two-dimensional   semantic   values   and   apriority   ,   but   the   connection   is   usually   limited   in   <br> </br>

   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="subject level2 subject2"> According </span> <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> to   Kaplan   ,   his   work   is   partly   grounded   in   work   in   tense   logic   by </span>  <br> </br>
   Kamp  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   1971   ) </span>  and   Vlach  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   1973   ) </span>  ,   which   gives   a   sort   of   two-dimensional   analysis   of   the   behavior   of   ‘   now   ’   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Kaplan   applies   his   analysis   to   indexicals   such   as   ‘   I   ’   ,   ‘   here   ’   ,   and   ‘   now   ’   ,   as   well   as   to   demonstratives   such   as   ‘   this   ’   and   ‘   that   ’   .   Kaplan   ’s   well-known   <br> </br>
   analysis   is   described   elsewhere   in   this   volume   ,   so   I   will   describe   it   only   briefly   here   .   For   Kaplan   ,   the   “   worlds   ”   involved   in   the   first   dimension   are   <br> </br>
   contexts   of   utterance   :   these   can   be   seen   as   at   least   involving   the   specification   of   a   speaker   and   a   time   and   place   of   utterance   ,   within   a   world   .   The   “   worlds   ”   <br> </br>
   involved   on   the   second   dimension   are   circumstances   of   evaluation   :   these   are   ordinary   possible   worlds   at   which   the   truth   of   an   utterance   is   to   be   evaluated   <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Consider   an   expression   such   as   :   (   1   )   I   am   hungry   now   According   to   Kaplan   ’s   analysis   ,   when   this   expression   is   uttered   by   Joe   at   time   t1   ,   it   expresses   a   <br> </br>
   proposition   that   is   true   if   and   only   if   Joe   is   hungry   at   t1   .   We   can   call   this   proposition   expressed   the   content   of   the   utterance   .   This   content   can   naturally   <br> </br>
   be   represented   as   an   intension   that   is   true   at   all   and   only   those   worlds  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   those   circumstances   of   evaluation   ) </span>  in   which   Joe   is   hungry   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   Kaplan   regards   propositions   as   structured   entities   rather   than   intensions   ,   but   the   difference   does   not   matter   much   here   .   )   In   a   different   context   say   ,   a   <br> </br>
   context   with   Diana   speaking   at   t2   an   utterance   of   the   same   expression   will   have   a   different   content   .   This   content   will   be   a   proposition   that   is   true   at   a   <br> </br>
   world   if   and   only   if   Diana   is   hungry   at   t2   in   that   world   .   The   character   of   an   expression   is   a   function   from   contexts   to   contents   ,   mapping   a   context   of   <br> </br>
   utterance   to   the   content   of   that   expression   in   that   context   .   (   If   content   is   seen   as   an   intension   ,   then   character   is   a   sort   of   two-dimensional   intension   .   )   <br> </br>
   So   the   character   of   ‘   I   am   hungry   ’   maps   the   first   context   above   to   the   proposition   that   Joe   is   hungry   at   t1   ,   and   the   second   context   above   to   the   proposition   <br> </br>
   that   Diana   is   hungry   at   t2   .   Extending   this   idea   to   subsentential   indexical   terms   ,   we   can   say   that   the   character   of   ‘   I   ’   maps   the   first   context   to   Joe   and   the   <br> </br>
   second   context   to   Diana   ;   more   generally   ,   it   maps   any   context   into   the   speaker   in   that   context   .   Similarly   ,   the   character   of   ‘   now   ’   maps   any   context   into   the   <br> </br>
   time   specified   in   that   context   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   above   definition   of   character   is   still   somewhat   imprecise   ,   and   many   tricky   issues   come   up   in   giving   a   precise   definition   .   But   to   a   rough   first   <br> </br>
   approximation   ,   one   can   say   that   the   character   of   an   expression   maps   a   context   to   the   content   that   the   expression   would   have   if   uttered   in   that   context   .   <br> </br>
   There   is   more   to   say   than   this   (   especially   as   Kaplan   intends   his   analysis   to   apply   even   to   contexts   in   which   there   is   no   token   of   the   relevant   utterance   )   ,   but   <br> </br>
   this   is   enough   for   now   .   In   general   ,   character   is   associated   with   an   expression   type   rather   than   with   an   expression   token   ,   although   this   matter   is   <br> </br>
   complicated   somewhat   by   the   case   of   demonstratives   such   as   ‘   this   ’   and   ‘   that   ’   ,   whose   character   may   vary   between   different   utterances   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   On   Kaplan   ’s   analysis   ,   the   character   of   indexicals   such   as   ‘   I   ’   ,   ‘   now   ’   ,   and   ‘   here   ’   ,   as   well   as   the   character   of   demonstratives   such   as   ‘   this   ’   and   ‘   that   ’   ,   <br> </br>
   reflects   their   cognitive   significance   .   For   example   ,   ‘   I   am   here   now   ’   has   a   propositional   content   that   is   true   in   only   some   worlds   ,   but   its   character   yields   <br> </br>
   a   proposition   that   is   true   in   all   contexts   of   utterance   .   (   Kaplan   does   not   “   diagonalize   ”   character   into   an   intension   ,   but   it   would   be   easy   enough   to   do   so   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   one   did   so   ,   then   ‘   I   am   here   now   ’   would   be   associated   with   a   diagonal   intension   that   is   necessarily   true   .   )   So   the   character   rather   than   the   content   seems   to   <br> </br>
   reflect   the   fact   that   the   sentence   can   be   known   a   priori   (   or   near   enough   )   .   Likewise   ,   when   a   true   utterance   of   ‘   this   is   that   ’   is   cognitively   significant   ,   the   <br> </br>
   occurrences   of   ‘   this   ’   and   ‘   that   ’   will   refer   to   the   same   object   ,   but   their   characters   will   differ   .   So   at   least   in   these   domains   ,   character   behaves   a   little   <br> </br>
   like   a   Fregean   sense   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   behavior   does   not   extend   to   other   expressions   ,   however   .   For   example   ,   Kaplan   holds   that   names   refer   to   the   same   individual   in   any   context   of   utterance   <br> </br>
   .   On   this   view   ,   co-extensive   names   such   as   ‘   Mark   Twain   ’   and   ‘   Samuel   Clemens   ’   will   have   exactly   the   same   character   ,   and   an   identity   such   as   ‘   Mark   Twain   is   <br> </br>
   Samuel   Clemens   ’   will   have   a   character   that   yields   a   true   proposition   in   every   context   ,   even   though   the   identity   appears   to   be   a   posteriori   and   cognitively   <br> </br>
   significant   .   Something   similar   applies   to   natural   kind   terms   such   as   ‘   water   ’   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   on   Kaplan   ’s   analysis   ,   names   and   natural   kind   terms   have   a   “   constant   character   ”   that   is   dissociated   from   their   cognitive   roles   .   One   can   diagnose   the   <br> </br>
   situation   by   noting   that   character   is   most   closely   tied   to   the   patterns   of   context-dependence   associated   with   an   expression   ,   rather   than   to   the   <br> </br>
   expression   ’s   cognitive   significance   .   In   the   case   of   indexicals   ,   the   patterns   of   context-   dependence   of   an   expression   are   themselves   closely   <br> </br>
   associated   with   the   expression   ’s   cognitive   significance   .   But   for   many   other   expressions   ,   such   as   names   and   natural   kind   terms   ,   cognitive   significance   <br> </br>
   is   strongly   dissociated   from   patterns   of   context-   dependence   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   The   same   goes   for   numerous   ordinary   context-dependent   expressions   ,   such   as   ‘   tall   ’   .   )   As   a   result   ,   in   the   general   case   ,   Kaplan   ’s   framework   is   better   <br> </br>
   suited   to   the   analysis   of   the   context-dependence   of   expressions   than   to   an   analysis   of   their   cognitive   significance   .   2.2   Stalnaker   :   Diagonal   <br> </br>
   proposition   and   proposition   expressed   Stalnaker   ’s   analysis   starts   with   the   idea   that   although   sentences   such   as   ‘   Hesperus   is   Phosphorus   ’   express   <br> </br>
   necessary   truths   ,   they   are   sometimes   used   to   convey   contingent   information   about   the   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Stalnaker  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> 1978 </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span></span>  analyzes   this   contingent   information   as   the   diagonal   proposition   associated   with   an   utterance   .   On   Stalnaker   ’s   analysis   ,   the   <br> </br>
   proposition   expressed   by   an   utterance   is   a   standard   intension   ,   or   a   set   of   possible   worlds   .   So   the   proposition   expressed   by   an   ordinary   utterance   of   ‘   <br> </br>
   Hesperus   is   Phosphorus   ’   is   the   set   of   worlds   in   which   Hesperus   is   Phosphorus   ,   which   is   the   set   of   all   worlds   (   leaving   aside   questions   about   existence   )   .
