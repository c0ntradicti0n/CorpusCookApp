  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> happen   that   two   expressions   have   the   same   extension   but   different   intensions </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   example   ,   Quine   ’s   terms   ‘   cordate   ’   (   creature   with   a   heart   )   and   ‘   renate   ’   (   creature   with   a   kidney   )   pick   out   the   same   class   of   individuals   in   the   actual   <br> </br>
   world   ,   so   they   have   the   same   extension   .   But   there   are   many   possible   worlds   where   they   pick   out   different   classes   (   any   possible   world   in   which   there   are   <br> </br>
   creatures   with   hearts   but   no   kidneys   ,   for   example   )   ,   so   they   have   different   intensions   .   When   two   expressions   have   the   same   extension   and   a   different   <br> </br>
   intension   in   this   way   ,   the   difference   in   intension   Carnap   (   1947   )   suggested   that   an   intension   behaves   in   many   respects   like   a   significance   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   example   ,   it   is   cognitively   significant   that   all   renates   are   cordates   and   vice   versa   (   this   was   a   nontrivial   empirical   discovery   about   the   world   )   ,   so   <br> </br>
   that   ‘   renate   ’   and   ‘   cordate   ’   should   have   different   Fregean   senses   .   One   might   naturally   suggest   that   this   difference   in   sense   is   captured   more   concretely   <br> </br>
   by   a   difference   in   intension   ,   and   will   have   the   same   intension   .   And   one   might   suppose   that   when   two   such   terms   are   cognitively   distinct   (   so   that   ‘   ab   ’   is   <br> </br>
   knowable   only   empirically   ,   for   example   )   ,   then   intensions   .   If   this   were   the   case   ,   the   distinction   between   intension   and   extension   could   be   seen   as   a   sort   <br> </br>
   of   vindication   of   a   Fregean   distinction   between   sense   and   reference   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   vindication   is   possible   .   According   to   Kripke   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> there   are   many   statements   that   are </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Phosphorus </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> are   identical </span>  to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> planet   Venus </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> in   all   possible   worlds </span>  .   If   <br> </br>
   so   ,   then   Venus   in   all   possible   worlds   )   ,   even   though   the   two   terms   are   cognitively   distinct   .   The   same   goes   for   pairs   of   terms   such   as   ‘   water   ’   and   ‘   H2O   ’   :   it   is   <br> </br>
   an   empirical   discovery   ‘   I   am   David   Chalmers   ’   expresses   nontrivial   empirical   knowledge   ,   but   Kripke   ’s   analysis   entails   that   I   am   David   Chalmers   in   all   <br> </br>
   worlds   ,   so   that   my   utterances   of   these   dissociated   from   cognitive   significance   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Still   ,   there   is   a   strong   intuition   that   the   members   of   these   pairs   (   ‘   Hesperus   ’   and   could   turn   out   so   that   these   terms   would   refer   to   different   things   .   For   <br> </br>
   example   ,   it   seems   to   be   at   least   epistemically   possible   (   in   some   broad   sense   )   that   these   terms   might   fail   to   corefer   .   On   the   face   of   it   ,   cognitive   <br> </br>
   differences   between   the   terms   is   connected   in   some   fashion   to   the   existence   of   these   possibilities   .   So   it   is   natural   to   these   cognitive   differences   .   This   <br> </br>
   is   perhaps   the   guiding   idea   behind   two-dimensional   semantics   .   the   same   extension   ,   and   have   the   same   (   Kripkean   )   intension   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   there   are   ways   things   could   have   turned   out   so   that   the   two   terms   could   have   had   a   different   extension   ,   and   a   different   intension   .   So   there   is   a   sense   in   <br> </br>
   which   for   a   term   like   ‘   water   ’   ,   the   term   ’s   extension   and   its   Kripkean   intension   depend   on   the   character   of   the   oceans   )   ,   ‘   Hesperus   ’   might   have   referred   to   <br> </br>
   something   quite   different   (   e.g.   XYZ   )   ,   and   it   might   have   had   an   entirely   different   Kripkean   intension   (   e.g.   one   that   picks   out   itself   depends   on   the   <br> </br>
   character   of   the   world   ,   then   we   can   represent   this   dependence   by   This   diagram   expresses   an   aspect   of   the   two-dimensional   structure   associated   turns   out   <br> </br>

   might   even   speculate   that   an   expression   ’s   diagonal   intension   behaves   in   some   respects   like   a   Fregean   sense   ,   in   a   way   that   might   vindicate   Carnap   ’s   <br> </br>

   A   number   of   different   two-dimensional   approaches   to   semantics   have   been   developed   in   the   and   Jackson   (   1998   )   ,   among   others   ;   and   closely   related   <br> </br>
   two-dimensional   analysis   of   Humberstone   (   1981   )   .   These   approaches   differ   greatly   in   the   way   that   they   make   the   intuitive   ideas   above   precise   .   They   <br> </br>
   differ   ,   for   example   ,   in   just   what   they   take   the   “   worlds   ”   in   the   left   column   to   be   ,   and   they   differ   in   their   analysis   of   how   a   term   ’s   intension   andor   extension   <br> </br>
   depends   on   the   character   of   the   actual   world   .   As   a   result   ,   dimensional   semantic   values   ,   and   these   semantic   values   have   quite   different   In   what   follows   ,   I   <br> </br>

For   Kaplan   ,   the   “   worlds   ”   involved   in   the   first </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> dimension   are   contexts   of   utterance   :   these   can   be   seen   as   at   least   involving   the   specification   of   a   speaker   and   a   time   and   place   of   utterance   ,   within   a   world </span>  <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   “   worlds   ”   involved   on   the   second   dimension   are   circumstances   of   evaluation   :   these   are   ordinary   possible   worlds   at   which   the   truth   of   an   utterance   is   to   <br> </br>
   be   evaluated   .   Consider   an   expression   such   as   :   According   to   Kaplan   ’s   analysis   ,   when   this   expression   is   uttered   by   Joe   at   time   t1   ,   it   expresses   a   <br> </br>
   proposition   that   is   true   if   and   only   if   Joe   is   hungry   at   t1   .   We   can   call   this   circumstances   of   evaluation   )   in   which   Joe   is   hungry   .   (   Kaplan   regards   <br> </br>
   propositions   as   structured   entities   rather   than   intensions   ,   but   the   difference   does   not   matter   much   here   .   )   <br> </br>

   In   a   different   context   say   ,   a   context   with   Diana   speaking   at   t2   an   utterance   of   the   same   expression   will   have   a   different   content   .   This   content   will   be   a   <br> </br>
   proposition   that   is   true   at   a   world   if   and   only   if   Diana   is   hungry   at   t2   in   that   world   .   seen   as   an   intension   ,   then   character   is   a   sort   of   two-dimensional   <br> </br>
   intension   .   )   So   the   hungry   at   t1   ,   and   the   second   context   above   to   the   proposition   that   Diana   is   hungry   at   t2   .   Extending   this   idea   to   subsentential   indexical   <br> </br>
   terms   ,   we   can   say   that   the   character   of   ‘   I   ’   maps   the   first   context   to   Joe   and   the   second   context   to   Diana   ;   more   generally   ,   it   maps   any   context   into   the   speaker   <br> </br>
   in   that   context   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>

   considers   the   following   sentence   :   (   2   )   If   anyone   invented   the   zip   ,   Julius   invented   the   zip   .   According   to   Evans   ,   however   ,   this   sort   of   contingency   is   <br> </br>
   superficial   .   (   2   )   is   superficially   contingent   ,   in   that   the   claim   ‘   It   might   have   been   the   case   that   someone   other   than   Julius   invented   the   zip   ’   is   true   .   <br> </br>

   .   Correspondingly   ,   it   seems   that   necessary   ,   so   that   an   identity   such   as   ‘   Mark   Twain   is   Samuel   Clemens   ’   is   not   only   superficially   necessary   but   deeply   <br> </br>

   actual   world   .   Davies   and   Humberstone   note   that   ‘   P   iff   AP   ’   is   contingent   but   knowable   actual   world   ,   ‘   P   iff   AP   ’   will   be   true   .   Likewise   ,   for   a   contingent   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Instead   of   simply   designating   a   fixed   world   as   the   actual   world   ,   we   take   actuality   to   be   a   feature   that   can   attach   to   different   worlds   .   We   can   then   evaluate   <br> </br>
   sentences   in   a   world   w   ,   where   a   world   w   ’   is   taken   to   be   actual   (   “   considered   as   actual   ”   )   .   Or   equivalently   ,   we   can   evaluate   sentences   at   pairs   of   worlds   (   w   ’   ,   w   )   <br> </br>
   ,   where   the   first   world   represents   the   world   that   is   designated   as   actual   ,   and   the   second   world   represents   the   world   in   which   the   sentence   is   evaluated   (   <br> </br>
   relative   to   the   designation   of   the   first   world   as   actual).2   Doubly-indexed   evaluation   behaves   as   follows   .   <br> </br>

   .   But   when   P   is   A-involving   ,   the   two   may   come   apart   .   In   particular   ,   the   sentence   ‘   P   iff   AP   ’   is   not   necessary   ,   but   it   is   FA-necessary   .   Likewise   ,   for   a   <br> </br>
   contingent   atomic   truth   P   ,   AP   is   necessary   ,   but   it   is   FA-contingent   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   Davies   and   Humberstone   suggest   that   FA-necessity   captures   the   respectively   .   Davies   and   Humberstone   also   extend   the   discussion   to   Evans   ’   case   of   <br> </br>
   descriptive   names   .   They   observe   that   descriptive   names   such   as   ‘   Julius   ’   behave   very   much   like   A-involving   descriptions   of   the   form   ‘   The   actual   inventor   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
