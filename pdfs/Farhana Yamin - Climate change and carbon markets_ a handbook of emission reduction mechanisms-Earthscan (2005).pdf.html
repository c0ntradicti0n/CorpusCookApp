   comes   at   a   timely   moment   .   Carbon   markets   are   developing   rapidly   across   the   globe   as   a   result   of   national   and   international   climate   policy   initiatives   .   It   <br> </br>
   is   less   than   six   months   before   the   start   of   the   European   Union   â€™s   Emission   Allowance   Trading   Scheme   and   it   is   already   clear   that   it   will   ,   in   many   respects   ,   <br> </br>
   become   a   landmark   in   EU   and   international   climate   change   policy   .   The   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   demonstrates   the   EU   â€™s   political   commitment   to   the   Kyoto   Protocol   and   its   innovative   mechanisms   .   One   should   remember   that   the   European   Union   for   a   long   <br> </br>
   time   was   not   very   fond   of   market-based   environment   policy   instruments   .   Even   today   ,   the   major   part   of   EU   environmental   legislation   is   based   on   â€˜   command   <br> </br>
   and   control   â€™   through   setting   technical   standards   for   individual   companies   ,   factories   and   consumers   .   The   implementation   of   the   EU   ETS   could   become   the   <br> </br>
   first   step   to   a   deeper   change   of   the   EU   â€™s   environment   policy   approach   .   In   a   world   characterized   by   global   economic   integration   and   enhanced   competition   ,   <br> </br>
   using   market-based   mechanisms   would   drive   environmental   policy   towards   more   cost-effectiveness   while   ensuring   at   the   same   time   the   achievement   of   its   <br> </br>
   environmental   objectives   .    [missing index]    [missing index]    [missing index]    [missing index]    [missing index]    [missing index]   <br> </br>

   Directive   will   certainly   be   remembered   as   one   of   the   most   ambitious   pieces   of   EU   legislation   as   regards   its   timetable   and   its   scope   .   Between   reaching   the   <br> </br>
   final   political   agreement   in   July   2003   and   the   actual   start   on   1   January   2005   ,   Member   States   and   the   Commission   have   only   18   months   to   transpose   the   <br> </br>
   Directive   into   national   legislation   ,   to   implement   all   related   secondary   legislation   such   as   the   monitoring   and   reporting   guidelines   as   well   as   the   <br> </br>
   Registries   Regulation   ,   and   to   set   up   the   electronic   registry   system   and   the   EU   â€™s   transaction   log   .   This   would   not   have   been   possible   without   the   <br> </br>
   determination   of   many   individuals   in   the   Commission   ,   the   Member   States   ,   the   European   Parliament   ,   the   UNFCCC   Secretariat   and   private   sector   as   well   as   <br> </br>
   non-governmental   organizations   .   The   fact   that   ,   during   the   first   phase   ,   only   carbon   dioxide   and   six   sectors   will   be   covered   might   give   the   false   <br> </br>
   impression   that   the   scheme   is   rather   xviii   Foreword   restrictive   .   The   opposite   is   true   :   12,000   to   14,000   industrial   installations   in   25   EU   Member   States   <br> </br>
   will   participate   .   More   than   40   per   cent   of   all   CO2   emissions   in   the   Union   will   be   covered   .   This   will   make   it   the   largest   emissions   trading   scheme   worldwide   .   <br> </br>
   One   important   reason   for   establishing   the   EU   ETS   is   to   engage   private   sector   companies   and   the   financial   sector   actively   in   the   fight   against   climate   <br> </br>
   change   .   No   doubt   ,   it   will   be   the   ingenuity   and   creativity   of   engineers   ,   economists   and   financial   specialists   in   these   companies   that   will   generate   the   <br> </br>
   new   ideas   and   technologies   that   are   necessary   to   reduce   greenhouse   gas   emissions   .   Since   Kyoto   in   1997   ,   those   actively   involved   have   grown   from   a   handful   <br> </br>
   of   experts   that   negotiated   the   Kyoto   Protocol   and   academics   that   fed   them   with   ideas   to   hundreds   of   â€˜   carbon   professionals   â€™   that   recently   attended   the   <br> </br>
   first   International   Carbon   Fair   in   Cologne   .   Many   foreign   companies   that   have   operations   in   Europe   are   also   becoming   familiar   with   the   idea   of   emissions   <br> </br>
   trading   .   Another   key   characteristic   of   the   EU   scheme   is   its   openness   to   other   schemes   and   to   emission   reduction   projects   abroad   .   This   should   reassure   <br> </br>
   those   that   feared   that   the   EU   ETS   is   about   â€˜   Fortress   Europe   â€™   .   Instead   ,   the   EU   is   open   to   cooperate   with   others   in   the   most   constructive   manner   <br> </br>
   acknowledging   that   no   country   or   political   block   in   this   world   will   be   able   to   combat   climate   change   on   its   own   .   Norway   ,   Switzerland   ,   Canada   and   New   <br> </br>
   Zealand   have   already   expressed   their   keen   interest   to   link   up   with   the   European   scheme   .   Colleagues   in   Japan   ,   Russia   ,   Australia   and   the   US   are   studying   it   <br> </br>
   with   great   interest   .   The   aspiration   for   the   EU   ETS   is   to   become   the   reference   for   a   much   larger   international   emissions   trading   scheme   at   the   company   level   <br> </br>
   .   Something   that   many   around   the   world   have   yet   to   realize   is   that   the   EU   ETS   already   puts   a   value   on   CDM   credits   as   of   1   January   2005   .   In   the   National   <br> </br>
   Allocation   Plans   that   have   been   scrutinized   to   date   Member   States   pronounce   already   that   they   will   buy   more   than   200   MT   CO2   over   the   first   commitment   <br> </br>
   period   .   This   provides   a   clear   signal   to   project   developers   around   the   world   and   will   hopefully   spur   the   transfer   of   technologies   .   It   should   inject   a   new   <br> </br>
   dynamic   into   the   debate   of   future   technology   development   and   transfer   .   The   EU   ETS   is   also   a   good   example   of   transatlantic   cooperation   .   The   Commission   has   <br> </br>
   learned   a   lot   from   the   sulphur   and   NOx   trading   schemes   that   are   in   place   in   the   United   States   and   excellent   professional   relationships   have   been   built   .   <br> </br>
   After   completing   the   legislative   process   in   Europe   and   coming   close   to   full   implementation   ,   an   increased   interest   in   many   states   in   the   US   in   emissions   <br> </br>
   trading   to   combat   climate   change   can   be   recognized   .   On   a   final   note   ,   there   is   no   doubt   that   ,   for   the   months   and   years   to   come   ,   the   EU   will   still   be   on   the   steep   <br> </br>
   end   of   the   learning   curve   as   regards   emissions   trading   .   Nobody   could   realistically   expect   that   the   EU   will   get   it   100   per   cent   right   the   first   time   .   At   the   <br> </br>
   present   moment   we   see   sometimes   fierce   debates   in   the   capitals   of   the   Foreword   xix   Member   States   on   the   allocation   of   emissions   rights   which   will   <br> </br>
   overnight   create   assets   worth   billions   of   euros   .   There   is   also   anxiety   in   parts   of   business   that   ,   in   future   ,   emissions   of   carbon   and   other   greenhouse   <br> </br>
   gases   would   be   priced   and   this   is   only   the   beginning   of   moving   into   a   carbon   constrained   world   .   For   others   ,   the   number   of   allowances   that   is   allocated   to   <br> </br>
   industry   is   far   too   high   .   Time   will   tell   .   â€˜   Learning   by   doing   â€™   is   an   important   in-built   feature   of   the   Emissions   Trading   Directive   .   For   all   these   reasons   ,   <br> </br>
   Farhana   Yamin   â€™s   handbook   explaining   emerging   emissions   reduction   mechanisms   in   Europe   and   elsewhere   comes   at   an   opportune   moment   .   She   has   been   able   to   <br> </br>
   gather   a   very   competent   ,   highly   professional   group   of   authors   .   All   of   them   have   been   deeply   involved   in   the   process   over   the   last   years   ,   whether   in   the   <br> </br>
   international   and   multilateral   negotiations   or   in   the   debate   in   the   European   Union   .   Their   contributions   provide   an   excellent   overview   of   emissions   <br> </br>
   reduction   mechanisms   such   as   emissions   trading   and   the   detailed   technical   issues   associated   with   their   implementation   across   the   globe   .   It   will   <br> </br>
   hopefully   reach   out   and   widen   the   audience   to   bring   those   on   board   that   had   not   been   involved   in   the   matter   in   the   past   .   I   am   confident   ,   therefore   ,   that   this   <br> </br>
   handbook   will   contribute   to   widening   the   understanding   of   emissions   trading   internationally   over   the   coming   years   and   how   we   came   to   where   we   are   today   .   <br> </br>
   Jos   Delbeke   Director   DG   Environment   European   Commission   Brussels   Preface   and   acknowledgements   This   book   has   taken   more   than   a   decade   to   write   .   <br> </br>
   Literally   .   My   interest   in   the   Kyoto   mechanisms   started   on   a   plane   journey   coming   back   from   the   Earth   Summit   held   in   Rio   de   Janeiro   in   1992   .   With   a   long   flight   <br> </br>

   .   Writing   in   our   journal   a   year   later   ,   and   with   the   benefit   of   discussions   with   other   FIELD   lawyers   working   on   climate   change   ,   Philippe   Sands   ,   James   <br> </br>
   Cameron   and   Jake   Werksman   ,   I   expressed   concerns   about   whether   forms   of   global   trading   schemes   could   be   agreed   internationally   ,   citing   by   way   of   example   <br> </br>
   the   difficulties   the   12   members   of   the   European   Community   were   then   having   agreeing   a   limited   scheme   covering   sulphur   and   nitrogen   oxides   among   <br> </br>
   themselves   .   I   would   certainly   not   have   believed   that   a   decade   later   the   international   community   would   put   over   two   hundred   pages   of   rules   <br> </br>
   operationalizing   an   array   of   global   trading   mechanisms   on   the   international   statute   book   ,   nor   that   the   European   Union   would   be   on   the   verge   of   commencing   <br> </br>
   the   largest   greenhouse   gas   emissions   trading   scheme   in   the   world   .   This   book   is   the   end   point   of   the   amazing   intellectual   and   professional   journey   that   I   <br> </br>
   have   been   on   since   that   flight   from   Rio   .   A   journey   I   have   had   the   good   fortune   of   sharing   with   many   of   the   contributors   to   this   book   who   have   been   working   on   the   <br> </br>
   mechanisms   issues   ,   in   many   cases   on   joint   projects   and   papers   .   The   chief   purpose   of   this   book   is   to   describe   the   rules   ,   institutions   and   procedures   agreed   <br> </br>
   internationally   and   at   the   European   Union   level   to   implement   the   three   trading-based   mechanisms   included   in   the   1997   Kyoto   Protocol   :   joint   <br> </br>
   implementation   ,   the   Clean   Development   Mechanism   and   international   emission   trading   ,   and   to   map   out   how   current   implementation   and   future   evolution   of   <br> </br>
   these   and   related   mechanisms   is   unfolding   in   jurisdictions   outside   the   EU   .   Devising   mechanisms   rules   has   involved   a   huge   amount   of   shared   learning   by   the   <br> </br>
   international   community   with   many   heated   arguments   along   the   way   .   In   many   ways   I   feel   privileged   that   my   differing   professional   roles   have   enabled   me   to   <br> </br>
   see   these   debates   from   many   perspectives   :   as   AOSIS   advisor   in   the   climate   negotiations   who   along   with   other   developing   country   negotiators   remains   a   <br> </br>
   little   cautious   about   the   mechanisms   ,   as   consultant   to   the   EU   Commission   advising   the   EU   on   the   legalpolicy   framework   to   implement   the   mechanisms   <br> </br>
   domestically   and   finally   as   an   academic   submitting   myself   to   the   cross-examination   of   students   who   always   seem   to   split   50:50   into   mechanisms   <br> </br>
   enthusiasts   and   critics   .   Involvement   in   these   differing   capacities   also   convinced   me   there   was   a   need   for   a   book   that   brought   together   mechanisms   rules   <br> </br>
   developed   in   different   legal   spheres   .   It   was   becoming   increasingly   difficult   to   keep   track   of   the   primary   materials   and   sources   of   further   reading   .   <br> </br>
   Somewhat   ironically   ,   the   rejection   of   the   Kyoto   Protocol   by   the   Bush   Administration   provided   further   impetus   because   it   brought   home   the   fact   that   <br> </br>
   linking   the   mechanisms   under   the   Kyoto   Protocol   with   current   and   future   developments   in   non-Parties   to   the   Protocol   would   require   a   better   <br> </br>
   understanding   of   how   domestic   trading   schemes   could   be   designed   to   be   Kyoto-independent   as   well   as   Kyoto-consistent   .   The   collection   of   contributions   <br> </br>
   in   this   book   is   designed   to   support   the   implementation   and   evolution   of   the   climate   change   regime   by   providing   an   accessible   account   of   the   rules   ,   <br> </br>
   procedures   and   institutions   governing   access   and   use   of   the   Kyoto   flexibility   mechanisms   ,   and   of   catalysing   discussions   about   the   contribution   these   <br> </br>
   mechanisms   might   play   in   the   design   of   the   future   climate   regime   .   My   biggest   thanks   go   to   my   fellow   authors   :   Jason   Anderson   ,   Rob   Bradley   ,   Michel   Colombier   <br> </br>
   ,   Richard   Baron   ,   Odile   Blanchard   ,   Erik   Haites   ,   Mark   Kenber   ,   Jrgen   Lefevere   ,   Axel   Michaelowa   ,   Fiona   Mullins   and   Martijn   Wilder   .   All   of   them   are   busy   <br> </br>
   mechanisms   specialists   advising   a   wide   range   of   governments   and   intergovernmental   and   non-governmental   organizations   and   all   responded   to   my   call   to   <br> </br>
   put   pen   to   paper   to   explain   the   mechanisms   rules   they   are   working   on   right   now   to   others   less   familiar   .   An   extra   special   thanks   goes   to   Jrgen   Lefevere   not   <br> </br>
   only   for   his   contribution   in   this   book   but   also   for   being   a   wonderful   colleague   during   the   19982002   period   when   the   intensity   of   mechanisms   discussions   ,   <br> </br>
   internationally   and   within   the   EU   ,   left   us   with   little   time   to   think   about   anything   else   .   My   deep   appreciation   also   goes   to   the   main   funder   of   this   book   ,   the   <br> </br>
   EU   Commission   ,   DG   Environment   ,   for   providing   the   financial   incentives   needed   to   write   it   ,   and   also   for   stewarding   the   European   Emission   Allowance   <br> </br>
   Trading   Scheme   through   the   EU   legislative   labyrinth   in   record   time   so   that   we   would   have   something   exciting   near   home   to   write   about   !   Well   deserved   thanks   <br> </br>
   are   due   to   the   past   and   present   members   of   the   Climate   Change   Unit   with   deep   respect   and   appreciation   of   the   role   played   by   Jos   Delbeke   ,   Peter   Vis   ,   Damien   <br> </br>
