 An   introduction   to   Zen   Buddhism   An   Evergreen   Black   Cat   Book   An   Introduction   to   Zen   Buddhism   Zen   Buddhism   With   a   Foreword   by   An   Evergreen   Black   Cat   %   fi   Book   <br> </br>
   All   Rights   Reserved   Manufactured   in   the   United   States   of   America   Authors   Preface   8   I   Preliminary   31   rv   Illogical   Zen   58   vn   Satori   ,   or   Acquiring   a   New   <br> </br>
   Viewpoint   88   THE   articles   collected   here   were   originally   written   for   the   Jew   East   ,   which   was   published   in   Japan   during   the   191   War   under   the   editorship   of   <br> </br>
   Mr.   Robertson   Scott   .   The   editor   suggested   publishing   them   in   book-form   ,   but   I   did   not   feel   like   doing   so   at   that   time   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Later   ,   they   were   made   the   basis   of   the   First   Series   of   my   Jen   Essays   (   1927   )   ,   which   ,   therefore   ,   naturally   cover   more   or   less   the   same   ground   .   Recently   ,   the   <br> </br>
   idea   came   to   me   that   the   old   papers   might   be   after   all   reprinted   in   book-form   .   The   reason   is   that   my   en   Essays   is   too   heavy   for   those   who   wish   to   have   just   a   <br> </br>
   little   preliminary   knowledge   of   Zen   .   Will   not   ,   therefore   ,   what   may   be   regarded   as   an   introductory   work   be   welcomed   by   some   of   my   foreign   friends   ?   With   this   <br> </br>
   in   view   I   have   gone   over   the   entire   MS   .   ,   and   whatever   inaccuracies   I   have   come   across   in   regard   to   diction   as   well   as   the   material   used   have   been   corrected   .   <br> </br>
   While   there   are   quite   a   few   points   I   would   like   to   see   now   expressed   somewhat   differendy   ,   I   have   left   them   as   they   stand   ,   because   their   So   long   as   they   are   not   <br> </br>
   misrepresenting   ,   they   may   remain   as   they   were   written   .   If   the   book   really   serves   as   a   sort   of   introduction   to   Zen   Buddhism   ,   and   leads   the   reader   up   to   the   <br> </br>
   study   of   my   other   works   ,   the   object   is   attained   .   No   claim   is   made   here   for   a   scholarly   treatment   of   the   subject-matter   .   The   companion   book   .   Manual   of   en   <br> </br>

   I   will   be   content   with   these   few   examples   ,   which   illustrate   clearly   the   opacity   of   the   satori   experiences   .   Even   if   we   take   example   after   example   ,   it   is   <br> </br>
   still   extremely   hazy   how   such   an   enlightenment   comes   and   of   what   it   consists   ;   in   other   words   ,   by   what   or   about   what   one   is   enlightened   .   Kaiten   Nukariya   ,   who   <br> </br>
   was   himself   a   Professor   at   the   So-To-Shu   Buddhist   College   in   Tokyo   ,   says   ,   speaking   of   enlightenment   Having   set   ourselves   free   from   the   misconception   of   <br> </br>
   Self   ,   next   we   must   awaken   our   innermost   wisdom   ,   pure   and   divine   ,   called   the   Mind   of   Buddha   ,   or   Bodhi   ,   or   Prajna   by   Zen   Masters   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   the   divine   light   ,   the   inner   heaven   ,   the   key   to   all   moral   treasures   ,   the   source   of   all   influence   and   power   ,   the   and   mercy   ,   the   measure   of   all   things   .   When   <br> </br>
   this   innermost   wisdom   is   fully   awakened   ,   we   are   able   to   realize   that   each   and   every   one   of   us   is   identical   in   spirit   ,   in   essence   ,   in   nature   with   the   universal   <br> </br>
   life   or   Buddha   ,   that   each   ever   lives   face   grace   of   the   Blessed   One   ,   that   He   arouses   his   moral   nature   ,   that   He   opens   his   spiritual   eyes   ,   that   He   unfolds   his   new   <br> </br>
   capacity   ,   that   He   appoints   his   mission   ,   and   that   life   is   not   an   ocean   of   birth   ,   disease   ,   old   age   and   death   ,   nor   the   vale   of   tears   ,   but   the   holy   temple   of   Buddha   <br> </br>
   ,   the   Pure   Land   ,   where   he   can   enjoy   the   bliss   of   Nirvana   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Then   our   minds   go   through   an   entire   revolution   .   We   are   no   more   troubled   by   anger   and   hatred   ,   no   more   bitten   by   envy   and   ambition   ,   no   more   stung   by   sorrow   and   <br> </br>
   chagrin   ,   no   more   overwhelmed   by   melancholy   and   despair   ,   etc   .   That   is   how   an   Oriental   ,   himself   a   disciple   of   Zen   ,   describes   the   essence   of   enlightenment   .   <br> </br>
   It   must   be   admitted   that   this   passage   would   need   only   the   most   minute   alterations   in   order   not   to   be   out   of   place   in   any   Christian   mystical   book   of   devotion   .   <br> </br>
   Yet   somehow   it   fails   to   help   us   as   regards   understanding   the   satori   experience   described   by   this   all-embracing   casuistry   .   <br> </br>

   completely   ejected   from   the   sphere   of   koan   and   kwatsu   and   satori   It   is   far   better   to   allow   oneself   to   become   deeply   imbued   beforehand   with   the   exotic   <br> </br>
   obscurity   of   the   Zen   anecdotes   ,   and   to   bear   in   mind   the   whole   time   that   satori   is   a   mysterium   ineffabile   ,   as   indeed   the   Zen   masters   wish   it   to   be   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Between   the   anecdotes   and   the   mystical   enlightenment   there   is   ,   for   our   understanding   ,   a   gulf   ,   the   pMDSsibility   of   bridging   which   can   at   best   be   indicated   <br> </br>
   but   never   in   practice   achieved   .   One   has   the   feeling   of   touching   upon   a   true   secret   ,   not   something   that   has   been   imagined   or   pretended   ;   this   is   not   a   case   of   <br> </br>
   mystifying   secrecy   ,   but   rather   of   an   experience   that   baffles   all   languages   .   Satori   comes   as   something   unexpected   ,   not   to   be   expected   .   When   within   the   <br> </br>
   realm   of   Christianity   visions   of   the   Holy   Trinity   ,   the   Madonna   ,   the   Crucifixion   or   the   Patron   Saint   are   vouchsafed   ,   one   has   the   impression   that   this   is   <br> </br>
   more   or   less   as   it   should   be   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   It   is   harder   to   accept   Master   Eckeharts   vision   of   the   litde   naked   boy   ,   or   even   Swedenborgs   man   in   the   red   coat   who   wanted   to   wean   him   from   overeating   ,   and   whom   <br> </br>
   ,   in   spite   of   this   or   perhaps   because   of   it   ,   he   recognized   as   the   Lord   God   .   Such   things   are   difficult   to   accept   ,   bordering   as   they   do   on   the   grotesque   .   Many   of   <br> </br>
   the   satori   experiences   ,   however   ,   do   not   merely   border   on   the   grotesque   ;   they   are   right   there   in   the   midst   of   it   ,   sounding   like   now   thought   fit   to   disregard   .   <br> </br>
   As   a   philosopher   ,   one   is   exclusively   concerned   with   that   understanding   which   ,   for   its   own   part   ,   has   nothing   to   do   with   life   .   <br> </br>

   For   anyone   who   docs   not   share   or   understand   this   point   of   view   ,   the   explanation   will   consist   of   nothing   but   words   which   have   no   tangible   meaning   for   him   .   He   <br> </br>

   these   anecdotes   to   the   realm   of   amusing   fairv   stories   ,   or   at   least   ,   if   one   accepts   the   facts   as   they   or   redeemed   ,   or   whether   he   merely   imagines   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   have   no   criteria   for   this   .   Moreover   ,   we   know   weU   enough   that   an   imaginary   pain   is   often   far   more   painful   than   a   so-called   real   one   ,   in   that   it   is   <br> </br>
   accompanied   by   a   subtle   moral   suffering   caused   by   the   gloomy   feeling   of   secret   self-accusation   .   It   is   not   ,   therefore   ,   a   question   of   actual   fact   but   o   [   <br> </br>
   spiritual   reality   ;   that   were   this   not   so   ,   there   could   be   no   consciousness   and   no   phenomenality   of   the   occurrence   .   The   imagination   itself   is   a   psychic   <br> </br>
   occurrence   ,   and   therefore   whether   an   enlightenment   5   Earlier   on   I   raised   the   question   of   whether   we   have   anything   like   satori   in   the   West   .   <br> </br>

   If   we   except   the   sayings   of   our   Western   mystics   ,   a   superficial   glance   discloses   nothing   that   could   be   likened   to   it   in   even   the   faintest   degree   .   According   <br> </br>
   to   our   of   the   existence   of   an   object   and   the   consciousness   of   the   consciousness   of   an   object   borders   on   a   subtlety   which   can   scarcely   be   answered   .   One   could   <br> </br>
   hardly   bring   oneself   to   take   such   a   problem   so   seriously   as   to   take   account   of   the   psychological   conditions   of   the   setting   of   any   such   problem   .   It   is   <br> </br>
   characteristic   that   the   posing   of   such   and   similar   questions   does   not   as   a   rule   arise   from   any   intellectual   need   ,   but   where   it   exists   is   nearly   always   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   This   new   condition   of   consciousness   ,   arising   from   religious   practice   ,   is   distinguished   by   the   fact   that   outward   things   no   longer   affect   an   ego-like   <br> </br>
   consciousness   ,   whence   a   reciprocal   attachment   has   arisen   ,   but   that   an   empty   consciousness   stands   open   to   another   influence   .   This   other   influence   will   <br> </br>
   no   longer   be   felt   as   ones   own   activity   ,   but   as   the   work   of   a   non-ego   which   has   consciousness   as   its   object   .   It   is   as   though   the   subject-character   of   the   ego   had   <br> </br>
   been   overrun   ,   or   taken   over   ,   by   another   subject   which   has   taken   the   place   of   the   ego   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   a   question   of   that   well-known   religious   experience   which   has   been   formulated   by   St.   Paul   Gal   .   ii   ,   20   )   .   Here   a   new   condition   of   consciousness   is   <br> </br>
   undoubtedly   described   ,   separated   from   the   former   condition   of   consciousness   by   means   of   a   far-reaching   process   of   religious   transformation   .   It   could   <br> </br>
   be   objected   that   consciousness   in   itselwas   not   changed   ,   but   only   the   consciousness   of   something   ,   just   as   though   one   had   turned   over   the   page   of   a   book   and   <br> </br>
   now   saw   a   different   picture   with   the   same   eyes   .   I   am   afraid   this   conception   is   no   more   than   an   arbitrary   interpretation   ,   as   it   does   not   conform   with   the   facts   <br> </br>

   .   A   classic   example   is   the   Wu-   or   Mu-anecdote   .   A   monk   once   asked   the   master   ,   Has   a   dog   Buddhist   nature   ,   too   ?   ,   whereupon   the   master   answered   ,   Wu   .   <br> </br>

   As   Suzuki   remarks   ,   this   Wu   means   quite   simply   Wu   ,   obviously   just   what   the   dog   himself   would   have   said   in   answer   to   the   question   .   At   first   glance   it   would   <br> </br>
   apjear   that   the   submission   of   such   a   question   as   food   for   meditation   would   mean   an   anticipation   or   prejudicing   of   the   final   result   ,   and   that   the   contents   of   <br> </br>
   the   meditation   would   be   determined   thereby   ,   rather   like   the   Jesuit   Exercises   ,   or   certain   Yogi   meditations   ,   the   substance   of   which   is   determined   by   a   task   <br> </br>
   submitted   by   the   teacher   .   The   koans   ,   however   ,   are   of   such   great   variety   ,   such   ambiguit   )   ,   and   above   all   of   such   overwhelming   paradoxy   ,   that   even   an   expert   <br> </br>
   is   completely   in   the   dark   as   to   what   may   emerge   as   a   suitable   solution   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Moreover   ,   the   descriptions   of   the   experiences   are   so   obscure   that   in   no   single   case   could   one   perceive   any   unobjectionable   rational   connection   betsveen   <br> </br>
   the   koan   and   the   experience   .   Since   no   logical   succession   can   ever   be   proved   ,   it   is   individual   predisposition   of   the   initiate   .   The   complete   destruction   of   <br> </br>
   the   rational   intellect   aimed   at   in   the   training   creates   an   al-   manifestly   satori   .   This   ,   at   least   ,   appears   to   me   to   be   the   \-iew   which   ,   by   all   descriptions   ,   <br> </br>
   would   express   the   essence   of   satori   that   the   glimpse   into   ones   ovm   nature   ,   the   original   man   and   the   depth   of   the   being   are   often   to   the   Zen   master   a   matter   of   <br> </br>
   supreme   concern   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   is   an   image   and   must   therefore   be   set   aside   .   Nothing   must   be   present   except   what   is   actually   there   ;   that   is   ,   man   with   his   complete   ,   unconscious   supposition   <br> </br>
   ,   of   which   ,   simply   because   it   is   unconscious   ,   he   can   never   ,   never   rid   himself   .   The   answer   which   appears   to   come   from   a   void   ,   the   light   which   flares   up   from   the   <br> </br>
   blackest   darkness   ,   these   have   always   been   experiences   of   wonder-   restrictions   ,   of   walls   blocking   the   way   .   It   is   of   necessity   always   Attentiveness   is   ,   <br> </br>
   however   ,   an   effort   of   which   we   are   not   permanently   capable   .   <br> </br>

   We   have   therefore   to   make   do   ,   so   to   speak   ,   with   a   minimum   of   simultaneous   perceptions   and   successions   of   images   .   Hence   wide   fields   of   possible   perceptions   <br> </br>
   are   per-   ai   picture   of   all   that   it   could   imagine   is   beyond   conception   .   If   man   has   already   succeeded   in   building   up   the   structure   of   the   world   from   the   few   <br> </br>
   clear   things   that   he   can   perceive   at   one   and   the   same   time   ,   what   godly   spectacle   would   present   itself   to   his   eyes   were   he   able   to   perceive   a   great   deal   all   at   <br> </br>
