   <br> </br>
   The   Meditation   Hall   and   the   Monks   Life   118   THE   articles   collected   here   were   originally   written   for   the   Jew   East   ,   which   was   published   in   Japan   during   the   191   <br> </br>
   4   War   under   the   editorship   of   Mr.   Robertson   Scott   .   The   editor   suggested   publishing   them   in   book-form   ,   but   I   did   not   feel   like   doing   so   at   that   time   .   Later   ,   <br> </br>
   they   were   made   the   basis   of   the   First   Series   of   my  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Jen   Essays </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   1927   ) </span>  ,   which   ,   therefore   ,   naturally   cover   more   or   less   the   same   ground   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Recently   ,   the   idea   came   to   me   that   the   old   papers   might   be   after   all   reprinted   in   book-form   .   The   reason   is   that   my   en   Essays   is   too   heavy   for   those   who   wish   to   <br> </br>
   have   just   a   little   preliminary   knowledge   of   Zen   .   Will   not   ,   therefore   ,   what   may   be   regarded   as   an   introductory   work   be   welcomed   by   some   of   my   foreign   friends   <br> </br>
   ?   With   this   in   view   I   have   gone   over   the   entire   MS   .   ,   and   whatever   inaccuracies   I   have   come   across   in   regard   to   diction   as   well   as   the   material   used   have   been   <br> </br>
   corrected   .   While   there   are   quite   a   few   points   I   would   like   to   see   now   expressed   somewhat   differendy   ,   I   have   left   them   as   they   stand   ,   because   their   revision   <br> </br>
   inevitably   involves   the   recasting   of   the   entire   context   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   long   as   they   are   not   misrepresenting   ,   they   may   remain   as   they   were   written   .   If   the   book   really   serves   as   a   sort   of   introduction   to   Zen   Buddhism   ,   and   leads   <br> </br>
   the   reader   up   to   the   study   of   my   other   works   ,   the   object   is   attained   .   No   claim   is   made   here   for   a   scholarly   treatment   of   the   subject-matter   .   The   companion   <br> </br>
   book   .   Manual   of   en   Buddhism   ,   is   recommended   to   be   used   with   this   Introduction   .   Kamakura   ,   August   1934   by   Dr.   C.   G.   Jung   D   AiSETz   Teitaro   Suzukis   works   on   Zen   <br> </br>
   Buddhism   are   among   the   best   contributions   to   the   knowledge   of   living   Buddhism   that   recent   decades   have   produced   ,   and   Zen   itself   is   the   most   impxDrtant   <br> </br>
   fruit   that   has   sprung   from   that   tree   whose   roots   are   the   collections   of   the   Pali-Canon   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   can   not   be   sufficiendy   grateful   to   the   author   ,   first   for   the   fact   of   his   having   brought   Zen   closer   to   Western   understanding   ,   and   secondly   for   the   manner   <br> </br>
   in   which   he   has   achieved   this   task   .   Oriental   religious   conceptions   are   usually   so   very   different   from   our   Western   ones   that   even   the   very   translation   of   <br> </br>
   the   words   brings   one   up   against   the   greatest   difficulties   ,   quite   apart   from   the   meaning   of   the   ideas   exposed   ,   which   under   certain   circumstances   are   <br> </br>
   better   left   untranslated   .   I   have   only   to   mention   the   Chinese   Tao\   which   no   European   translation   has   yet   achieved   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   original   Buddhist   writings   themselves   contain   views   and   ideas   which   are   more   or   less   unassimilable   by   the   average   Western   understanding   .   I   do   not   <br> </br>
   know   ,   for   example   ,   just   what  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> spiritual   (   or   perhaps   climatic   ?   ) </span>  <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   background   or   preparation   is   necessary   before   one   can   deduce   any   completely   clear   idea   from   the   Buddhist   Kamma   .   In   spite   of   all   that   we   know   about   the   <br> </br>
   essence   of   Zen   ,   here   too   there   is   the   question   of   a   central   perception   of   unsurpassed   singularity   .   This   strange   perception   is   called   Saton   ,   and   may   be   <br> </br>
   translated   as   Enlightenment   .   Suzuki   says   (   see   page   95   )   ,   Satori   is   the   raison   detre   of   Zen   ,   and   without   it   there   is   no   Zen   .   It   should   not   be   too   difficult   for   <br> </br>
   the   Western   mind   to   grasp   what   a   mystic   understands   by   enlightenment   ,   or   what   is   known   as   enlightenment   in   religious   parlance   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   origin   ,   aa   Oriental   authors   themselves   admit   ,   is   the   Flower   Sermon   of   Buddha   .   On   this   occasion   he   held   up   a   flower   to   a   gathering   of   students   ,   without   <br> </br>
   uttering   a   word   .   Only   Kasapa   understood   him   .   (   Shuej   Ohasama   :   en   .   Dtr   Ubendige   Buddhismus   in   Japan   ,   1925   ,   p.   3   .   )   9   Satori   ,   however   ,   depicts   an   art   and   a   way   <br> </br>
   of   enlightenment   which   is   practically   impossible   for   the   European   to   appreciate   .   I   would   point   out   the   enlightenment   of   Hyakujo   (   Pai-chang   92   -   3   of   this   <br> </br>
   book   .   The   following   may   serve   as   a   fiirther   example   :   A   monk   once   went   to   Gensha   ,   and   wanted   to   learn   where   the   entrance   to   the   path   of   truth   was   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Gensha   asked   him   ,   Do   you   hear   the   murmuring   of   the   brook   ?   Yes   ,   I   hear   it   ,   answered   the   monk   .   There   is   the   entrance   ,   the   master   instructed   him   .   I   will   be   <br> </br>
   content   with   these   few   examples   ,   which   illustrate   clearly   the   opacity   of   the   satori   experiences   .   Even   if   we   take   example   after   example   ,   it   is   still   <br> </br>
   extremely   hazy   how   such   an   enlightenment   comes   and   of   what   it   consists   in   other   words   ,   by   what   or   about   what   one   is   enlightened   .   Kaiten   Nukariya   ,   who   was   <br> </br>
   himself   a   Professor   at   the   So-To-Shu   Buddhist   College   in   Tokyo   ,   says   ,   speaking   of   enlightenment   :   Having   set   ourselves   free   from   the   misconception   of   <br> </br>
   Self   ,   next   we   must   awaken   our   innermost   wisdom   ,   pure   and   divine   ,   called   the   Mind   of   Buddha   ,   or   Bodhi   ,   or   Prajna   by   Zen   Masters   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   the   divine   light   ,   the   inner   heaven   ,   the   key   to   all   moral   treasures   ,   the   source   of   all   influence   and   power   ,   the   seat   of   kindness   ,   justice   ,   sympathy   ,   <br> </br>
   impartial   love   ,   humanity   ,   and   mercy   ,   the   measure   of   all   things   .   When   this   innermost   wisdom   is   fully   awakened   ,   we   are   able   to   realize   that   each   and   every   one   <br> </br>
   of   us   is   identical   in   spirit   ,   in   essence   ,   in   nature   with   the   universal   life   or   Buddha   ,   that   each   ever   lives   face   to   face   with   Buddha   ,   that   each   is   beset   by   the   <br> </br>
   abundant   grace   of   the   Blessed   One   ,   that   He   arouses   his   moral   nature   ,   that   He   opens   his   spiritual   eyes   ,   that   He   unfolds   his   new   capacity   ,   that   He   appoints   his   <br> </br>
   mission   ,   and   that   life   is   not   an   ocean   of   birth   ,   disease   ,   old   age   and   death   ,   nor   the   vale   of   tears   ,   but   the   holy   temple   of   Buddha   ,   the   Pure   Land   ,   where   he   can   <br> </br>
   enjoy   the   bliss   of   Nirvana   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Then   our   minds   go   through   an   entire   revolution   .   We   are   no   more   troubled   by   anger   and   hatred   ,   no   more   bitten   by   envy   and   ambition   ,   no   more   stung   by   sorrow   and   <br> </br>
   chagrin   ,   no   more   overwhelmed   by   melancholy   and   despair   ,   etc   .   That   is   how   an   Oriental   ,   himself   a   disciple   of   Zen   ,   describes   the   essence   of   enlightenment   .   <br> </br>
   It   must   be   admitted   that   this   passage   would   need   only   the   most   minute   alterations   in   order   not   to   be   out   of   place   in   any   Christian   mystical   book   of   devotion   .   <br> </br>
   Yet   somehow   it   fails   to   help   us   as   regards   understanding   the   satori   experience   described   by   this   all-embracing   casuistry   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Presumably   Nukariya   is   speaking   to   Western   rationalism   ,   of   which   he   himself   has   acquired   a   good   dose   ,   and   that   is   why   it   all   sounds   so   flatly   edifying   .   The   <br> </br>
   abstruse   obscurity   of   the   Zen   anecdotes   is   preferable   to   this   adaptation   :   ad   usum   Delphini   it   conveys   a   great   deal   more   ,   while   saying   less   .   en   is   anything   <br> </br>
   but   a   philosophy   in   the   Western   sense   of   the   word   .   This   is   the   opinion   expressed   by   Rudolf   Otto   in   his   introduction   to   Ohasamas   book   on   en   ,   when   he   says   that   <br> </br>
   Nukariya   has   fitted   the   magic   oriental   world   of   ideas   into   our   Western   philosophic   categories   ,   and   confused   it   with   these   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> psycho-physical </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> parallelism </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> , </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> most </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> wooden </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> of </span></span>  all   doctrines   ,   is   invoked   in   order   to   explain   this   mystical   intuition   of   Not-twoness   fichtzweiheit   )   <br> </br>
   and   Oneness   and   the   coincidentia   oppositorium   ,   one   is   completely   ejected   from   the   sphere   of   koan   and   kwatsu   and   satori   It   is   far   better   to   allow   oneself   to   <br> </br>
   become   deeply   imbued   beforehand   with   the   exotic   obscurity   of   the   Zen   anecdotes   ,   and   to   bear   in   mind   the   whole   time   that   satori   is   a   mysterium   ineffabile   ,   as   <br> </br>
   indeed   the   Zen   masters   wish   it   to   be   .   Between   the   anecdotes   and   the   mystical   enlightenment   there   is   ,   for   our   understanding   ,   a   gulf   ,   the   pMDSsibility   of   <br> </br>
   bridging   which   can   at   best   be   indicated   but   never   in   practice   achieved   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   has   the   feeling   of   touching   upon   a   true   secret   ,   not   something   that   has   been   imagined   or   pretended   this   is   not   a   case   of   mystifying   secrecy   ,   but   rather   of   <br> </br>
   Zen   is   neither   psychology   nor   philosophy   .   Otto   in   Ohasama   :   n   ,   p.   viii   .   If   in   spite   of   this   I   attempt   explanationa   in   what   follows   ,   I   am   still   fully   aware   that   <br> </br>
   in   the   sense   ofsatcri   what   I   say   can   only   be   useless   .   I   could   not   resist   ,   however   ,   the   attempt   to   manoeuvre   our   Western   understanding   at   least   into   the   <br> </br>
   proximity   of   an   understandinga   task   so   difficult   that   in   so   doing   one   must   take   upon   oneself   certain   crimes   against   the   spirit   of   Zen   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   II   an   experience   that   baffles   all   languages   .   Satori   comes   as   something   unexpected   ,   not   to   be   expected   .   When   within   the   realm   of   Christianity   visions   of   <br> </br>
   the   Holy   Trinity   ,   the   Madonna   ,   the   Crucifixion   or   the   Patron   Saint   are   vouchsafed   ,   one   has   the   impression   that   this   is   more   or   less   as   it   should   be   .   That   <br> </br>
   Jacob   Boehme   should   obtain   a   glimpse   into   the   centrum   naturae   by   means   of   the   sunbeam   reflected   in   the   tin   plate   is   also   understandable   .   It   is   harder   to   <br> </br>
   accept   Master   Eckeharts   vision   of   the   litde   naked   boy   ,   or   even   Swedenborgs   man   in   the   red   coat   who   wanted   to   wean   him   from   overeating   ,   and   whom   ,   in   spite   of   <br> </br>
   this   or   perhaps   because   of   it   ,   he   recognized   as   the   Lord   God   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Such   things   are   difficult   to   accept   ,   bordering   as   they   do   on   the   grotesque   .   Many   of   the   satori   experiences   ,   however   ,   do   not   merely   border   on   the   grotesque   <br> </br>
   they   are   right   there   in   the   midst   of   it   ,   sounding   like   complete   nonsense   .   For   anyone   ,   however   ,   who   has   devoted   considerable   time   to   studying   with   loving   <br> </br>
   and   understanding   care   the   flowerlike   nature   of   the   spirit   of   the   Far   East   ,   many   of   these   amazing   things   ,   which   drive   the   all   too   simple   European   from   one   <br> </br>
   perplexity   to   another   ,   fall   away   .   Zen   is   indeed   one   of   the   most   wonderful   blossoms   of   the   Chinese   spirit   ,   which   was   readily   impregnated   by   the   immense   <br> </br>
   thought-world   of   Buddhism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   He   ,   therefore   ,   who   has   really   tried   to   understand   Buddhist   doctrine   ,   if   only   to   a   certain   degreei.e   .   by   renouncing   various   Western   prejudiceswill   come   <br> </br>
   upon   certain   depths   beneath   the   bizarre   cloak   of   the   individual   satori   experiences   ,   or   will   sense   disquieting   difficulties   which   the   philosophic   and   <br> </br>
   religious   West   has   up   to   now   thought   fit   to   disregard   .   As   a   philosopher   ,   one   is   exclusively   concerned   with   that   understanding   which   ,   for   its   own   part   ,   has   <br> </br>
   nothing   to   do   with   life   .   And   as   a   Christian   ,   one   has   nothing   to   do   with   paganism   (   I   thank   thee   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Lord   ,   that   I   am   not   as   other   men   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   is   no   satori   within   these   Western   boundsthat   is   an   Oriental   affair   .   But   is   it   really   so   ?   Have   we   in   fact   no   satori   ?   See   Texte   am   der   deuUchen   Mystik   des   <br> </br>
   14   und   15   ,   Jahrhunderts   ,   published   by   Adolf   Spamer   ,   1912   ,   p.   143   .   William   White   :   Emanuel   Swedenborg   ,   1867   ,   Vol   .   I   ,   p.   243   .   Zen   is   undoubtedly   one   of   the   <br> </br>
   most   precious   and   in   many   respects   one   of   the   most   remarkable   spiritual   graces   with   which   Oriental   man   has   been   blessed   .   (   Suzviki   :   Essays   ,   I   ,   p.   249   .   )   12   <br> </br>
   When   one   examines   the   Zen   text   attentively   ,   one   can   not   escape   the   impression   that   ,   with   all   that   is   bizarre   in   it   ,   satori   is   ,   in   fact   ,   a   matter   of   natural   <br> </br>
   occurrence   ,   of   something   so   very   simple   that   one   fails   to   see   the   wood   for   the   trees   ,   and   in   attempting   to   explain   it   ,   invariably   says   the   very   thing   that   <br> </br>
   drives   others   into   the   greatest   confusion   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Nukariya   therefore   is   right   when   he   says   that   any   attempt   to   explain   or   analyse   the   contents   of   Zen   vs-ith   regard   to   enlightermaent   would   be   in   vain   .   <br> </br>
   Nevertheless   ,   this   author   does   venture   to   say   of   enlightenment   that   it   embraces   an   insight   into   the   nature   of   self   ,   and   that   it   is   an   emancipation   of   the   <br> </br>
   conscious   from   an   illusionary   conception   of   self   .   The   illusion   regarding   the   nature   of   self   is   the   common   confusion   of   the   ego   with   self   .   Nukariya   <br> </br>
   understands   by   self   the   All-Buddha   ,   i.e.   simply   a   total   consciousness   Bewtisstsein-   stotalitdl   )   of   life   .   He   quotes   Pan   Shan   ,   who   says   ,   The   world   of   the   <br> </br>
   mind   encloses   the   whole   universe   in   its   light   ,   adding   ,   It   is   a   cosmic   life   and   a   cosmic   spirit   ,   and   at   the   same   time   an   individual   life   and   an   individual   <br> </br>
   spirit   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   one   may   define   self   ,   it   is   always   something   other   than   the   ego   ,   and   inasmuch   as   a   higher   understanding   of   the   ego   leads   on   to   self   the   latter   is   a   thing   <br> </br>
   of   wider   scope   ,   embracing   the   knowledge   of   the   ego   and   therefore   surpassing   it   .   In   the   same   way   as   the   ego   is   a   certain   knowledge   of   my   self   so   is   the   self   a   <br> </br>
   knowledge   of   my   ego   ,   which   ,   however   ,   is   no   longer   experienced   in   the   form   of   a   broader   or   higher   ego   ,   but   in   the   form   of   a   non-ego   Nichi-Ich   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Such   thoughts   are   zdso   familiar   to   the   author   of   Deutsche   Theologie   :   Any   creature   who   is   to   become   conscious   of   this   perfection   must   first   lose   all   <br> </br>

   and   folly   .   Were   I   conscious   of   the   truth   ,   I   would   also   be   aware   that   I   am   not   Good   ,   that   Good   is   not   mine   and   is   not   of   me   .   Man   says   ,   Poor   fool   that   I   am   ,   I   was   under   <br> </br>
   the   delusion   that   I   was   it   ,   but   I   find   it   is   and   was   truly   God   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   That   already   states   a   considerable   amount   regarding   the   contents   of   enlightenment   .   The   occurrence   of   satori   is   interpreted   and   formulated   as   a   <br> </br>
   break-through   of   a   consciousness   limited   to   the   ego-form   in   the   form   of   the   non-ego-like   self   .   This   con-   ception   answers   to   the   nature   of   Zen   ,   but   also   to   <br> </br>
   the   mysticism   of   Master   Eckehart   .   The   master   says   ,   in   his   sermon   on   Blessed   are   the   poor   in   spirit   :   When   I   came   out   from   God   ,   all   things   said   ,   There   is   a   God   !   <br> </br>
   But   that   can   not   make   me   blissful   ,   for   with   it   I   conceive   myself   to   be   a   creature   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   in   the   break-   through   ,   when   I   wish   to   remain   empty   in   the   will   of   God   ,   and   empty   also   of   this   will   of   God   and   of   all   his   works   ,   and   of   God   himselfthen   I   am   more   <br> </br>
   than   all   creatures   ,   for   I   am   neither   God   nor   creature   :   am   what   I   am   ,   and   what   I   will   remain   ,   now   and   forever   !   Then   I   receive   a   jerk   ,   which   raises   me   above   all   the   <br> </br>
   angels   .   In   this   jerk   I   become   so   rich   that   God   can   not   suffice   me   ,   in   spite   of   all   that   he   is   as   God   ,   in   spite   of   all   his   Godly   works   for   in   this   break-through   I   <br> </br>
   perceive   what   God   and   I   are   in   common   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   am   then   what   I   was   ,   I   grow   neither   less   nor   more   ,   for   I   am   an   immovable   being   who   moves   all   things   .   Here   God   no   longer   abides   in   man   ,   for   man   through   his   poverty   <br> </br>
   has   won   back   what   he   has   always   been   and   will   always   be   .   Here   the   master   is   actually   describing   a   satori   experience   ,   a   release   of   the   ego   through   self   ,   to   <br> </br>
   which   Buddha-Nature   ,   or   godly   universality   ,   is   added   .   Since   ,   out   of   scientific   modesty   ,   I   do   not   here   presume   to   make   any   metaphysical   declaration   ,   but   <br> </br>
   mean   a   change   of   consciousness   that   can   be   experienced   ,   MeisUr   Eckeharts   SckrifUn   und   PredigUn   .   <br> </br>

   A   serious   and   responsible   examination   of   the   strange   phenomena   can   not   lighdy   pass   over   these   facts   .   We   can   of   course   never   decide   definitely   whether   a   <br> </br>
   person   is   really   enlightened   or   redeemed   ,   or   whether   he   merely   imagines   it   .   We   have   no   criteria   for   this   .   Moreover   ,   we   know   weU   enough   that   an   imaginary   <br> </br>
   pain   is   often   far   more   painful   than   a   so-called   real   one   ,   in   that   it   is   accompanied   by   a   subtle   moral   suffering   caused   by   the   gloomy   feeling   of   secret   <br> </br>
   self-accusation   .   It   is   not   ,   therefore   ,   a   question   of   actual   fact   but   o   [   spiritual   reality   that   is   to   say   ,   the   psychic   occurrence   of   the   happening   known   as   <br> </br>
   satori   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Every   spiritual   happening   is   a   picture   and   an   imagination   were   this   not   so   ,   there   could   be   no   consciousness   and   no   phenomenality   of   the   occurrence   .   The   <br> </br>
   imagination   itself   is   a   psychic   occurrence   ,   and   therefore   whether   an   enlightenment   is   called   real   or   imaginary   is   quite   immaterial   .   The   man   who   has   <br> </br>
   enlightenment   ,   or   alleges   that   he   has   it   ,   thinks   in   any   case   that   he   is   enlightened   .   WTiat   others   think   about   it   can   determine   nothing   whatever   for   him   with   <br> </br>
   regard   to   his   experience   .   Even   if   he   were   to   lie   ,   his   lie   would   be   a   spiritual   fact   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yes   ,   even   if   all   religious   reports   were   nothing   but   conscious   inventions   and   falsifications   ,   a   very   interesting   psychological   treatise   could   still   be   <br> </br>
   written   on   the   fact   of   such   lies   ,   with   the   same   scientific   treatment   wth   which   the   psychopathology   of   delusions   is   presented   .   The   fact   that   there   is   a   <br> </br>
   religious   movement   upon   which   many   briUiant   minds   have   worked   over   a   period   of   many   centuries   is   sufficient   reason   for   venturing   at   least   5   upon   a   serious   <br> </br>
   attempt   to   bring   such   happenings   within   the   realm   of   scientific   understanding   .   Earlier   on   I   raised   the   question   of   whether   we   have   anything   like   satori   in   <br> </br>
   the   West   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   we   except   the   sayings   of   our   Western   mystics   ,   a   superficial   glance   discloses   nothing   that   could   be   likened   to   it   in   even   the   faintest   degree   .   According   <br> </br>
   to   our   thinking   ,   the   possibility   that   there   are   steps   in   the   development   of   consciousness   does   not   exist   .   The   mere   thought   that   there   is   a   tremendous   <br> </br>
   psychological   difference   between   the   consciousness   of   the   existence   of   an   object   and   the   consciousness   of   the   consciousness   of   an   object   borders   on   a   <br> </br>
   subtlety   which   can   scarcely   be   answered   .   One   could   hardly   bring   oneself   to   take   such   a   problem   so   seriously   as   to   take   account   of   the   psychological   <br> </br>
   conditions   of   the   setting   of   any   such   problem   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   characteristic   that   the   posing   of   such   and   similar   questions   does   not   as   a   rule   arise   from   any   intellectual   need   ,   but   where   it   exists   is   nearly   always   <br> </br>
   rooted   in   a   primitive   religious   practice   .   In   India   it   was   Yoga   and   in   China   Buddhism   which   supplied   the   motive   power   for   these   attempts   to   wrest   oneself   <br> </br>
   from   the   bonds   of   a   certain   state   of   consciousness   which   was   felt   to   be   incomplete   .   As   far   as   Western   mysticism   is   concerned   ,   its   texts   are   full   of   <br> </br>
   instructions   as   to   how   man   can   and   must   release   himself   from   the   I-ness   (   Ichhatigkeit   )   of   his   consciousness   ,   so   that   through   the   know-   ledge   of   his   being   he   <br> </br>
   may   raise   himself   above   it   and   reach  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> inward </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   godlike   ) </span>  man   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Ruysbroeck   makes   use   of   an   image   which   is   also   known   to   Indian   philosophers   ,   namely   the   tree   that   has   its   roots   above   and   its   top   below   ,   And   he   must   climb   up   <br> </br>
   into   the   tree   of   belief   ,   which   grows   downwards   ,   since   it   has   its   roots   in   the   godhead   .
