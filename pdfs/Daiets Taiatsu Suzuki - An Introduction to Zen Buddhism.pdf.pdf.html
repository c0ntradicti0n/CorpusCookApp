   War   under   the   editorship   of   Mr.   Robertson   Scott   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   editor   suggested   publishing   them   in </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> book-form </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   but   I   did   not   feel   like   doing   so   at   that   time </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Later   ,   they   were   made   the   basis   of   the   First   Series   of   my   Jen   Essays   (   1927   )   ,   which   ,   therefore   ,   naturally   cover   more   or   less   the   same   ground   .   Recently   ,   the   <br> </br>
   idea   came   to   me   that   the   old   papers   might   be   after   all   reprinted   in   book-form   .   The   reason   is   that   my   en   Essays   is   too   heavy   for   those   who   wish   to   have   just   a   <br> </br>
   little   preliminary   knowledge   of   Zen   .   Will   not   ,   therefore   ,   what   may   be   regarded   as   an   introductory   work   be   welcomed   by   some   of   my   foreign   friends   ?   With   this   <br> </br>
   in   view   I   have   gone   over   the   entire   MS   .   ,   and   whatever   inaccuracies   I   have   come   across   in   regard   to   diction   as   well   as   the   material   used   have   been   corrected   .   <br> </br>
   While   there   are   quite   a   few   points   I   would   like   to   see   now   expressed   somewhat   differendy   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   have   left   them   as   they   stand   ,   because   their </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> revision </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> inevitably </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   We   can   not   be   sufficiendy   grateful   to   the   author   ,   first   for   the   fact   of   his   having   brought   Zen   closer   to   Western   understanding   ,   and   secondly   for   the   manner   <br> </br>
   in   which   he   has   achieved   this   task   .   Oriental   religious   conceptions   are   usually   so   very   different   from   our   Western   ones   that   even   the   very   translation   of   <br> </br>
   the   words   brings   one   up   against   the   greatest   difficulties   ,   quite   apart   from   the   meaning   of   the   ideas   exposed   ,   which   under   certain   circumstances   are   <br> </br>
   better   left   untranslated   .   I   have   only   to   mention   the   Chinese   Tao\   which   no   European   translation   has   yet   achieved   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   original   Buddhist   writings   themselves   contain   views   and   ideas   which   are   more   or   less   unassimilable   by   the   average   Western   understanding   .   I   do   not   <br> </br>
   know   ,   for   example   ,   just   what   spiritual   (   or   perhaps   climatic   ?   )   background   or   preparation   is   necessary   before   one   can   deduce   any   completely   clear   idea   <br> </br>
   from   the   Buddhist   Kamma   .   In   spite   of   all   that   we   know   about   the   essence   of   Zen   ,   here   too   there   is   the   question   of   a   central   perception   of   unsurpassed   <br> </br>
   singularity   .   This   strange   perception   is   called   Saton   ,   and   may   be   translated   as   Enlightenment   .   Suzuki   says   (   see   page   95   )   ,   Satori   is   the   raison   detre   of   Zen   <br> </br>
   ,   and   without   it   there   is   no   Zen   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   should   not   be   too   difficult   for   the   Western   mind   to   grasp   what   a   mystic   understands   by   enlightenment   ,   or   what   is   known   as   enlightenment   in   religious   <br> </br>
   parlance   .   The   origin   ,   aa   Oriental   authors   themselves   admit   ,   is   the   Flower   Sermon   of   Buddha   .   On   this   occasion   he   held   up   a   flower   to   a   gathering   of   students   ,   <br> </br>
   without   uttering   a   word   .   Only   Kasapa   understood   him   .   (   Shuej   Ohasama   :   en   .   Dtr   Ubendige   Buddhismus   in   Japan   ,   1925   ,   p.   3   .   )   9   Satori   ,   however   ,   depicts   an   art   <br> </br>
   and   a   way   of   enlightenment   which   is   practically   impossible   for   the   European   to   appreciate   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Even   if   we   take   example   after   example   ,   it   is   still   extremely   hazy   how   such   an   enlightenment   comes   and   of   what   it   consists   in   other   words   ,   by   what   or   about   what   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   en   is   anything   but   a   philosophy   in   the   Western   sense   of   the   word   .   This   is   the   opinion   expressed   by   Rudolf   Otto   in   his   introduction   to   Ohasamas   book   on   en   ,   when   <br> </br>
   he   says   that   Nukariya   has   fitted   the   magic   oriental   world   of   ideas   into   our   Western   philosophic   categories   ,   and   confused   it   with   these   .   If   <br> </br>
   psycho-physical   parallelism   ,   the   most   wooden   of   all   doctrines   ,   is   invoked   in   order   to   explain   this   mystical   intuition   of   Not-twoness   fichtzweiheit   )   <br> </br>
   and   Oneness   and   the   coincidentia   oppositorium   ,   one   is   completely   ejected   from   the   sphere   of   koan   and   kwatsu   and   satori   It   is   far   better   to   allow   oneself   to   <br> </br>
   become   deeply   imbued   beforehand   with   the   exotic   obscurity   of   the   Zen   anecdotes   ,   and   to   bear   in   mind   the   whole   time   that   satori   is   a   mysterium   ineffabile   ,   as   <br> </br>
   indeed   the   Zen   masters   wish   it   to   be   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Between   the   anecdotes   and   the   mystical   enlightenment   there   is   ,   for   our   understanding   ,   a   gulf   ,   the   pMDSsibility   of   bridging   which   can   at   best   be   indicated   <br> </br>
   but   never   in   practice   achieved   .   One   has   the   feeling   of   touching   upon   a   true   secret   ,   not   something   that   has   been   imagined   or   pretended   this   is   not   a   case   of   <br> </br>
   mystifying   secrecy   ,   but   rather   of   Zen   is   neither   psychology   nor   philosophy   .   Otto   in   Ohasama   :   n   ,   p.   viii   .   If   in   spite   of   this   I   attempt   explanationa   in   what   <br> </br>
   follows   ,   I   am   still   fully   aware   that   in   the   sense   ofsatcri   what   I   say   can   only   be   useless   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   could   not   resist   ,   however   ,   the   attempt   to   manoeuvre   our   Western   understanding   at   least   into   the   proximity   of   an   understandinga   task   so   difficult   that   in   <br> </br>
   so   doing   one   must   take   upon   oneself   certain   crimes   against   the   spirit   of   Zen   .   II   an   experience   that   baffles   all   languages   .   Satori   comes   as   something   <br> </br>
   unexpected   ,   not   to   be   expected   .   When   within   the   realm   of   Christianity   visions   of   the   Holy   Trinity   ,   the   Madonna   ,   the   Crucifixion   or   the   Patron   Saint   are   <br> </br>
   vouchsafed   ,   one   has   the   impression   that   this   is   more   or   less   as   it   should   be   .   <br> </br>

   ,   in   spite   of   this   or   perhaps   because   of   it   ,   he   recognized   as   the   Lord   God   .   Such   things   are   difficult   to   accept   ,   bordering   as   they   do   on   the   grotesque   .   Many   of   <br> </br>
   the   satori   experiences   ,   however   ,   do   not   merely   border   on   the   grotesque   they   are   right   there   in   the   midst   of   it   ,   sounding   like   complete   nonsense   .   For   anyone   <br> </br>

   psychopathology   of   delusions   is   presented   .   The   fact   that   there   is   a   religious   movement   upon   which   many   briUiant   minds   have   worked   over   a   period   of   many   <br> </br>
   centuries   is   sufficient   reason   for   venturing   at   least   5   upon   a   serious   attempt   to   bring   such   happenings   within   the   realm   of   scientific   understanding   .   <br> </br>
   Earlier   on   I   raised   the   question   of   whether   we   have   anything   like   satori   in   the   West   .   If   we   except   the   sayings   of   our   Western   mystics   ,   a   superficial   glance   <br> </br>
   discloses   nothing   that   could   be   likened   to   it   in   even   the   faintest   degree   .   According   to   our   thinking   ,   the   possibility   that   there   are   steps   in   the   <br> </br>
   development   of   consciousness   does   not   exist   .   The   mere   thought   that   there   is   a   tremendous   psychological   difference   between   the   consciousness   of   the   <br> </br>
   existence   of   an   object   and   the   consciousness   of   the   consciousness   of   an   object   borders   on   a   subtlety   which   can   scarcely   be   answered   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   could   hardly   bring   oneself   to   take   such   a   problem   so   seriously   as   to   take   account   of   the   psychological   conditions   of   the   setting   of   any   such   problem   .   It   <br> </br>
   is   characteristic   that   the   posing   of   such   and   similar   questions   does   not   as   a   rule   arise   from   any   intellectual   need   ,   but   where   it   exists   is   nearly   always   <br> </br>
   rooted   in   a   primitive   religious   practice   .   In   India   it   was   Yoga   and   in   China   Buddhism   which   supplied   the   motive   power   for   these   attempts   to   wrest   oneself   <br> </br>
