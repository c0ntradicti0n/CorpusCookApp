   January   2004   Those   who   concede   that   such   divergences   exist   adhere   ,   in   the   main   ,   to   one   or   the   other   of   two   rival   groups   ,   which   for   the   purposes   of   this   <br> </br>
   article   I   shall   call   the   formalist   and   the   informalist   groups   .   An   outline   of   a   not   uncharacteristic   formalist   position   may   be   given   as   follows   :   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Insofar   as   logicians   are   concerned   with   the   formulation   of   very   general   patterns   of   valid   inference   ,   the   formal   devices   possess   a   decisive   advantage   <br> </br>
   over   their   natural   counterparts   .   For   it   will   be   possible   to   construct   in   terms   of   the   formal   devices   a   system   of   very   general   formulas   ,   a   considerable   <br> </br>
   number   of   which   can   be   regarded   as   ,   or   are   closely   related   to   ,   patterns   of   inferences   the   expression   of   which   involves   some   or   all   of   the   devices   :   Such   a   <br> </br>
   system   may   consist   of   a   certain   set   of   simple   formulas   that   must   be   acceptable   if   the   devices   have   the   meaning   that   has   been   assigned   to   them   ,   and   an   <br> </br>
   indefinite   number   of   further   formulas   ,   many   of   them   less   obviously   acceptable   ,   each   of   which   can   be   shown   to   be   acceptable   if   the   members   of   the   original   <br> </br>
   set   are   acceptable   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   have   ,   thus   ,   a   way   of   handling   dubiously   acceptable   patterns   of   inference   ,   and   if   ,   as   is   sometimes   possible   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> we   can   apply   a   decision </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> procedure </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   we   have   an </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> even   better   way </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Furthermore   ,   from   a   philosophical   point   of   view   ,   the   possession   by   the   natural   counterparts   of   those   elements   in   their   meaning   ,   which   they   do   not   share   <br> </br>
   with   the   corresponding   formal   devices   ,   is   to   be   regarded   as   an   imperfection   of   natural   languages   ;   the   elements   in   question   are   undesirable   excrescences   <br> </br>
   .   For   the   presence   of   these   elements   has   the   result   that   the   concepts   within   which   they   appear   can   not   be   preciselyclearly   defined   ,   and   that   at   least   some   <br> </br>
   statements   involving   them   can   not   ,   in   some   circumstances   ,   be   assigned   a   definite   truth   value   ;   and   the   indefiniteness   of   these   concepts   is   not   only   <br> </br>
   objectionable   in   itself   but   leaves   open   the   way   to   metaphysics-we   can   not   be   certain   that   none   of   these   natural   language   expressions   is   metaphysically   <br> </br>
   loaded   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>

   (   I   do   not   wish   to   suggest   that   all   formalists   would   accept   the   whole   of   this   outline   ,   but   I   think   that   all   would   accept   at   least   some   part   of   it   .   )   Logic   and   <br> </br>

   are   especially   amenable   to   systematic   treatment   by   the   logician   ,   it   remains   the   case   that   there   are   very   many   inferences   and   arguments   ,   expressed   in   <br> </br>
   natural   language   and   not   in   terms   of   thes   devices   ,   that   are   nevertheless   recognizably   valid   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   there   must   be   a   place   for   an   unsimplified   ,   and   so   more   or   less   unsystematic   ,   logic   of   the   natural   counterparts   of   these   devices   ;  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> this </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> logic </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> may   be   aided </span>  <br> </br>

   The   point   of   this   maneuver   is   to   avoid   having   ,   on   each   occasion   ,   to   choose   between   this   or   that   member   of   the   family   of   verbs   for   which   implicate   is   to   do   <br> </br>
   general   duty   .   I   shall   ,   for   the   time   being   at   least   ,   have   to   assume   to   a   considerable   extent   an   intuitive   understanding   of   the   meaning   of   say   in   such   contexts   <br> </br>
   ,   and   an   ability   to   recognize   particular   verbs   as   members   of   the   family   with   which   implicate   is   associated   .   I   can   ,   however   ,   make   one   or   two   remarks   that   may   <br> </br>
   help   to   clarify   the   more   problematic   of   these   assumptions   ,   namely   ,   that   connected   with   the   meaning   of   the   word   sa[.   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   following   may   provide   a   first   approximation   to   a   general   principle   .   Our   talk   exchanges   do   not   normally   consist   of   a   succession   of   disconnected   <br> </br>
   remarks   ,   and   would   not   be   rational   if   they   did   .   They   are   characteristically   ,   to   some   degree   at   least   ,   cooperative   efforts   ;   and   each   participant   <br> </br>
   recognizes   in   them   ,   to   some   extent   ,   a   common   purpose   or   set   of   purposes   ,   or   at   least   a   mutually   accepted   direction   .   This   purpose   or   direction   may   be   fixed   <br> </br>
   from   the   start   (   e.g.   ,   by   an   initial   proposal   of   a   question   for   discussion   )   ,   or   it   may   evolve   during   the   exchange   ;   it   may   be   fairly   definite   ,   or   it   may   be   so   <br> </br>
   indefinite   as   to   leave   very   considerable   latitude   to   the   participants   (   as   in   a   casual   conversation   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   at   each   stage   ,   SOME   possible   conversational   moves   would   be   excluded   as   conversationally   unsuitable   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> We   might   then   formulate   a   rough   general </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> principle   which   participants   will   be   expected   (   ceteris   paribus   )   to   observe   ,   namely   :   Make   your   conversational   contribution   such   as   is   required   ,   at   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> stage   at   which   it   occurs   ,   by   the   accepted   purpose   or   direction   of   the   talk   exchange   in   which   you   are   engaged </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   might   label   this   the   COOPEHATIVE   PIUNCIPLE   .   On   the   assumption   that   some   such   general   principle   as   this   is   acceptable   ,   one   may   perhaps   distinguish   <br> </br>
   four   categories   under   one   or   another   of   which   will   fall   certain   more   specific   maxims   and   submaxims   ,   the   following   of   which   will   ,   in   general   ,   yield   results   <br> </br>
   in   accordance   with   the   Cooperative   Principle   .   Echoing   Kant   ,   I   call   these   categories   Quantity   ,   Quillity   ,   Relation   ,   and   Manner   .   The   category   of   QUANTITY   <br> </br>
   relates   to   the   quantity   of   information   to   be   provided   ,   and   under   it   fall   the   following   maxims   :   1   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Make   your   contribution   as </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> informative </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as   is   required   (   for   the   current   purposes   of   the   exchange   ) </span>  .   (   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> The </span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level2 subject2"> second   maxim </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> is   disputable   ;   it   might   be   said   that   to   be </span> <span class="subject level2 subject2"> overinfoimative </span> <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> is   not   a   transgression   of   the   CP   but   merely   a   waste   of   time </span></span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> . </span>  However   ,   it   might   be   answered   that   such   overinformativeness   may   be   confusing   in   that   it   is   liable   to   raise   side   issues   ;   and   there   may   also   be   an   indirect   <br> </br>
   effect   ,   in   that   the   hearers   may   be   misled   as   a   result   of   thinking   that   there   is   some   particular   POINT   in   the   provision   of   the   excess   of   information   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   this   may   be   ,   there   is   perhaps   a   different   reason   for   doubt   about   the   admission   of   this   second   maxim   ,   namely   ,   that   its   effect   will   be   secured   by   a   <br> </br>
   later   maxim   ,   which   concems   relevance   .   )   Under   the   category   of   QUALITY   falls   a   supennaxim-   Try   to   make   your   contribution   one   that   is   true   -and   two   more   <br> </br>
   specific   maxims   :   Under   the   category   of   RELATION   I   place   a   single   maxim   ,   namely   ,   Be   relevant   .   Though   the   maxim   itself   is   terse   ,   its   formulation   conceals   a   <br> </br>
   number   of   problems   that   exercise   me   a   good   deal   :   questions   about   what   different   kinds   and   focuses   of   relevance   there   may   be   ,   how   these   shift   in   the   course   of   <br> </br>
   a   talk   exchange   ,   how   to   allow   for   the   fact   that   subjects   of   conversation   are   legitimately   changed   ,   and   so   on   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   find   the   treatment   of   such   questions   exceedingly   difficult   ,   and   I   hope   to   revert   to   them   in   a   later   work   .   And   one   might   need   others   .   It   is   obvious   that   the   <br> </br>
   observance   of   some   of   these   maxims   is   a   matter   of   less   urgency   than   is   the   observance   of   others   ;   a   man   who   has   expressed   himself   with   undue   prolixity   would   ,   <br> </br>
   in   general   ,   be   open   to   milder   comment   than   would   a   man   who   has   said   something   he   believes   to   be   false   .   Indeed   ,   it   might   be   felt   that   the   importance   of   at   least   <br> </br>
   the   first   maxim   of   Quality   is   such   that   it   should   not   be   included   in   a   scheme   of   the   kind   I   am   constructing   ;   other   maxims   come   into   operation   only   on   the   <br> </br>
   assumption   that   this   maxim   of   Quality   is   satisfied   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   While   this   may   be   correct   ,   so   far   as   the   generation   of   Logic   and   Conversation   47   implicatures   is   concerned   it   seems   to   play   a   role   not   totally   different   from   <br> </br>
   the   other   maxims   ,   and   it   will   be   convenient   ,   for   the   present   at   least   ,   to   treat   it   as   a   member   of   the   list   of   maxims   .   There   are   ,   of   course   ,   all   sorts   of   other   <br> </br>
   maxims   (   aesthetic   ,   social   ,   or   moral   in   character   )   ,   such   as   Be   polite   ,   that   are   also   nom1ally   observed   by   participants   in   talk   exchanges   ,   and   these   may   <br> </br>

   As   one   of   my   avowed   aims   is   to   see   talking   as   a   special   case   or   variety   of   purposive   ,   indeed   rational   ,   behavior   ,   it   may   be   worth   noting   that   the   specific   <br> </br>
   expectations   or   presumptions   connected   with   at   least   some   of   the   foregoing   maxims   have   their   analogues   in   the   sphere   of   transactions   that   are   not   talk   <br> </br>

   well-recognized   empirical   fact   that   people   DO   behave   in   these   ways   ;   they   have   learned   to   do   so   in   childhood   and   not   lost   the   habit   of   doing   so   ;   and   ,   indeed   ,   <br> </br>
