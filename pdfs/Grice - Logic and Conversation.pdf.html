   uncharacteristic   formalist   position   may   be   given   as   follows   :   <br> </br>

   For   it   will   be   possible   to   construct   in   terms   of   the   formal   devices   a   system   of   very   general   formulas   ,   a   considerable   number   of   which   can   be   regarded   as   ,   or   <br> </br>
   are   closely   related   to   ,   patterns   of   inferences   the   expression   of   which   involves   some   or   all   of   the   devices   :   Such   a   system   may   consist   of   a   0   Used   by   <br> </br>

   University   Press   .   Copyright   1975   by   II   .   Paul   Grice   .   41   -   certain   set   of   simple   formulas   that   must   be   acceptable   if   the   devices   have   the   meaning   that   has   been   <br> </br>
   assigned   to   them   ,   and   an   indefinite   number   of   further   formulas   ,   many   of   them   less   obviously   acceptable   ,   each   of   which   can   be   shown   to   be   acceptable   if   the   <br> </br>
   members   of   the   original   set   are   acceptable   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   have   ,   thus   ,   a   way   of   handling   dubiously   acceptable   patterns   of   inference   ,   and   if   ,   as   is   sometimes   possible   ,   we   can   apply   a   decision   procedure   ,   we   have   an   <br> </br>
   even   better   way   .   Furthermore   ,   from   a   philosophical   point   of   view   ,   the   possession   by   the   natural   counterparts   of   those   elements   in   their   meaning   ,   which   <br> </br>
   they   do   not   share   with   the   corresponding   formal   devices   ,   is   to   be   regarded   as   an   imperfection   of   natural   languages   the   elements   in   question   are   <br> </br>
   undesirable   excrescences   .   For   the   presence   of   these   elements   has   the   result   that   the   concepts   within   which   they   appear   can   not   be   preciselyclearly   <br> </br>
   defined   ,   and   that   at   least   some   statements   involving   them   can   not   ,   in   some   circumstances   ,   be   assigned   a   definite   truth   value   and   the   indefiniteness   of   <br> </br>
   these   concepts   is   not   only   objectionable   in   itself   but   leaves   open   the   way   to   metaphysics-we   can   not   be   certain   that   none   of   these   natural   language   <br> </br>
   expressions   is   metaphysically   loaded   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   these   reasons   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   expressions   ,   as   used   in </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> natural   speech </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   can   not   be   regarded   as   finally   acceptable   ,   and   may   tum   out   to   be   ,   finally   ,   not   fully </span>  <br> </br>

   (   I   do   not   wish   to   suggest   that   all   formalists   would   accept   the   whole   of   this   outline   ,   but   I   think   that   all   would   accept   at   least   some   part   of   it   .   )   To   this   ,   an   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Moreover   ,   while   it   is   no   doubt   true   that   the   tormal   devices   are   especially   amenable   to   systematic   treatment   by   the   logician   ,   it   remains   the   case   that   there   <br> </br>
   are   very   many   inferences   and   arguments   ,   expressed   in   natural   language   and   not   in   terms   of   thes   devices   ,   that   are   nevertheless   recognizably   valid   .   So   <br> </br>
   there   must   be   a   place   for   an   unsimplified   ,   and   so   more   or   less   unsystematic   ,   logic   of   the   natural   counterparts   of   these   devices   this   logic   may   be   aided   and   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Now   ,   on   the   general   question   of   the   place   in   philosophy   of   the   reformation   of   natural   language   ,   I   shall   ,   in   this   article   ,   have   nothing   to   say   .   I   shall   <br> </br>
   confine   myself   to   the   dispute   in   its   relatio11   to   the   alleged   divergences   mentioned   at   the   outset   .   I   have   ,   moreover   ,   no   intention   of   entering   the   fray   on   <br> </br>
   behalf   of   either   contestant   .   I   ,   ,   ish   ,   rather   ,   to   maintain   that   the   common   assumption   of   the   conte.tants   that   the   divergences   do   in   fact   exist   is   (   broadly   <br> </br>
   speaking   )   a   common   mistake   ,   and   that   the   mistake   arises   from   an   inadequate   attention   to   the   nature   and   importance   of   the   conditions   governing   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   shall   ,   therefore   ,   proceed   at   once   to   inquire   into   the   general   r   :   onditions   that   ,   in   one   way   or   another   ,   apply   to   conversation   as   such   ,   irrespective   of   its </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> he   likes   his   colleagues   ,   and   he   has   nt   been   to   prison   yet </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   At   this   point   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A   might   well   inquire   what </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> B </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   implying   ,   what   he   was   suggesting   ,   or   even   what   he   meant   by   saying   that </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> C </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> had   not   yet   been   to   prison </span>  .   <br> </br>

   I   think   it   is   clear   that   whatever   B   implied   ,   suggested   ,   meant   ,   etc   .   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> in   this   example   ,   is   distinct   from   what   B   said   ,   which   was   simply   that </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> C </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> had   not   been   to </span>  <br> </br>

   I   wish   to   introduce   ,   as   terms   of   art   ,   the   verl   implicate   and   the   related   nouns   implicature   (   cf   .   implying   )   and   implicatum   (   cf   .   what   is   implied   )   .   The   point   of   <br> </br>
   this   maneuver   is   to   avoid   having   ,   on   each   occasion   ,   to   choose   between   this   or   that   member   of   the   family   of   verbs   for   which   implicate   is   to   do   general   duty   .   I   <br> </br>
   shall   ,   for   the   time   being   at   least   ,   have   to   assume   to   a   considerable   extent   an   intuitive   understanding   of   the   meaning   of   say   in   such   contexts   ,   and   an   ability   <br> </br>
   to   recognize   particular   verbs   as   members   of   the   family   with   which   implicate   is   associated   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   can   ,   however   ,   make   one   or   two   remarks   that   may   help   to   clarify   the   more   problematic   of   these   assumptions   ,   namely   ,   that   connected   with   the   meaning   of   the   <br> </br>
   word   sa[.   In   the   sense   in   which   I   am   using   the   word   say   ,   I   intend   what   someone   has   said   to   be   closely   related   to   the   conventional   meaning   of   the   words   (   the   <br> </br>
   sentence   )   he   has   uttered   .   Suppose   someone   to   have   uttered   the   sentence   He   is   in   the   grip   of   a   vice   .   Given   a   knowledge   of   the   English   language   ,   but   no   <br> </br>
   knowledge   of   the   circumstances   of   the   utterance   ,   one   would   know   something   about   what   the   speaker   had   said   ,   on   the   assumption   that   he   was   speaking   standard   <br> </br>
   English   ,   and   speaking   literally   .   <br> </br>

   One   would   know   that   he   had   said   ,   about   some   particular   male   person   or   animal   x   ,   that   at   the   time   of   the   utterance   (   whatever   that   was   )   ,   either   (   1   )   x   was   unable   <br> </br>
   to   rid   himself   of   a   certain   kind   of   bad   character   trait   or   (   2   )   some   part   of   x   s   person   was   caught   in   a   certain   kind   of   tool   or   instrument   (   approximate   account   ,   <br> </br>
   of   course   )   .   But   for   a   full   identification   of   what   the   speaker   had   said   ,   one   would   need   to   know   (   a   )   the   identity   of   x   ,   (   b   )   the   time   of   utterance   ,   and   (   c   )   the   <br> </br>
   meaning   ,   on   the   particular   occasion   of   utterance   ,   of   the   phrase   in   the   grip   of   a   vice   [   a   decision   between   (   1   )   and   (   2   )   ]   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> This   brief   indication   of   my   use   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> say </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> leaves   it   open   whether   a   man   who   says   (   today   ) </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Harold   Wilson </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   a   great   man </span>  and  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> another   who   says   (   also   today   ) </span>  The   British   <br> </br>
   Prime   Minister   is   a   great   man   would   ,   if   each   knew   that   the   two   singular   terms   had   the   same   reference   ,   have   said   the   same   thing   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   whatever   decision   is   made   about   this   question   ,   the   apparatus   that   I   am   about   to   provide   will   be   capable   of   accounting   for   any   implicatures   that   might   <br> </br>
   depend   on   the   presence   of   one   rather   than   another   of   these   singular   terms   in   the   sentence   uttered   .   Such   implicatures   would   merely   be   related   to   different   <br> </br>
   maxims   .   In   some   cases   the   conventional   meaning   of   the   words   used   will   determine   what   is   implicated   ,   besides   helping   to   determine   what   is   said   .   If   I   say   (   <br> </br>
   smugly   )   ,   He   is   an   Englishman   he   is   ,   therefore   ,   brave   ,   I   have   certainly   committed   myself   ,   by   virtue   of   the   meaning   of   my   words   ,   to   its   being   the   case   that   his   <br> </br>
   being   brave   is   a   consequence   of   (   follows   from   )   his   being   an   Englishman   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   while   I   have   said   that   l   Logic   and   Conversation   45   he   is   an   Englishman   ,   and   said   that   he   is   brave   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   do   not   want   to   say   that   I   have   SAID   (   in   the   favored   sense   ) </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   I   do   not   want   to   say   that   my   utterance   of   this   sentence   would   be   ,   STIUCTL   Y   SPEAKING   ,   false   should   the   consequence   in   question   fail   to   hold   .   So   SOME   <br> </br>
   implicatures   are   conventional   ,   unlike   the   one   with   which   I   introduced   this   discussion   of   implicature   .   I   wish   to   represent   a   certain   subclass   of   <br> </br>
   no11conventional   implicaturcs   ,   which   I   shall   call   CONVJ   :   IISATIONAL   implicaturcs   ,   as   being   essentially   connected   with   certain   ge11cral   features   of   <br> </br>
   discourse   so   my   next   step   is   to   try   to   say   what   these   features   are   .   The   following   may   provide   a   first   approximation   to   a   general   principle   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Our </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> talk   exchanges </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> do   not   normally   consist   of   a   succession   of   disconnected   remarks   ,   and   would   not   be   rational   if   they   did   .

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> some   degree   at   least   ,   cooperative   efforts   and   each   participant   recognizes   in   them   ,   to   some   extent   ,   a   common   purpose   or   set   of   purposes   ,   or   at   least   a </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> mutually   accepted   direction </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> This   purpose   or   direction </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> may   be   fixed   from   the   start </span>  (  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> e.g.   ,   by   an   initial   proposal   of   a   question   for   discussion   )   ,   or   it   may   evolve   during   the   exchange   it   may </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> be   fairly   definite   ,   or   it   may   be   so   indefinite   as   to   leave   very   considerable   latitude   to   the   participants   (   as   in   a   casual   conversation   ) </span>  .   But   at   each   stage   ,   <br> </br>
   SOME   possible   conversational   moves   would   be   excluded   as   conversationally   unsuitable   .   We   might   then   formulate   a   rough   general   principle   which   <br> </br>
   participants   will   be   expected   (   ceteris   paribus   )   to   observe   ,   namely   :   Make   your   conversational   contribution   such   as   is   required   ,   at   the   stage   at   which   it   <br> </br>
   occurs   ,   by   the   accepted   purpose   or   direction   of   the   talk   exchange   in   which   you   are   engaged   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   might   label   this   the   COOPEHATIVE   PIUNCIPLE   .   On   the   assumption   that   some   such   general   principle   as   this   is   acceptable   ,   one   may   perhaps   distinguish   <br> </br>
   four   categories   under   one   or   another   of   which   will   fall   certain   more   specific   maxims   and   submaxims   ,   the   following   of   which   will   ,   in   general   ,   yield   results   <br> </br>
   in   accordance   with   the   Cooperative   Principle   .   Echoing   Kant   ,   I   call   these   categories   Quantity   ,   Quillity   ,   Relation   ,   and   Manner   .   The   category   of   QUANTITY   <br> </br>
   relates   to   the   quantity   of   information   to   be   provided   ,   and   under   it   fall   the   following   maxims   :   1   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Make   your   contribution   as   informative   as   is   required   (   for   the   current   purposes   of   the   exchange   )   .   2   .   Do   not   make   your   contribution   more   informative   than   is </span>  <br> </br>

(  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> second   maxim </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   disputable   it   might   be   said   that   to   be   overinfoimative   is   not   a   transgression   of   the   CP   but   merely   a   waste   of   time </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   ,   it   might   be   answered   that  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> such </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> overinformativeness </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> may   be   confusing   in   that   it   is   liable   to   raise   side   issues   and   there   may   also   be   an   indirect </span>  <br> </br>

However   <br> </br>
   this   may   be   ,   there   is   perhaps   a   different   reason   for   doubt   about   the   admission   of   this   second   maxim   ,   namely   ,   that   its   effect   will   be   secured   by   a   later   maxim   ,   <br> </br>

   2   .   Do   not   say   that   for   which   you   lack   adequate   evidence   .   Under   the   category   of   RELATION   I   place   a   single   maxim   ,   namely   ,   Be   relevant   .   Though   the   maxim   itself   <br> </br>
   is   terse   ,   its   formulation   conceals   a   number   of   problems   that   exercise   me   a   good   deal   :   questions   about   what   different   kinds   and   focuses   of   relevance   there   <br> </br>
   may   be   ,   how   these   shift   in   the   course   of   a   talk   exchange   ,   how   to   allow   for   the   fact   that   subjects   of   conversation   are   legitimately   changed   ,   and   so   on   .   I   find   <br> </br>
   the   treatment   of   such   questions   exceedingly   difficult   ,   and   I   hope   to   revert   to   them   in   a   later   work   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Finally   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> under </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> category </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> of </span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> MANNER </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> , </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> which </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> understand </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> relating </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> not </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> like </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> previous </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> categories </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> to </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> what </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> said </span></span>  but   ,   rather   ,   to   HOW   what   is   said   is   <br> </br>
   to   be   said   ,   I   include   the   supermaxim-   Be   perspicuous   -and   various   maxims   such   as   :   1   .   Avoid   obscurity   of   expression   .   2   .   Avoid   ambiguity   .   3   .   Be   brief   (   avoid   <br> </br>
   unnecessary   prolixity   )   .   4   .   Be   orderly   .   And   one   might   need   others   .   It   is   obvious   that   the   observance   of   some   of   these   maxims   is   a   matter   of   less   urgency   than   <br> </br>
   is   the   observance   of   others   a   man   who   has   expressed   himself   with   undue   prolixity   would   ,   in   general   ,   be   open   to   milder   comment   than   would   a   man   who   has   said   <br> </br>
   something   he   believes   to   be   false   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Indeed   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> it   might   be   felt   that   the   importance   of   at   least   the   first   maxim   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Quality </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   such   that   it   should   not   be   included   in   a   scheme   of   the   kind   I   am </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> constructing   other   maxims   come   into   operation   only   on   the   assumption   that   this   maxim   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Quality </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   satisfied </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   While   this   may   be   correct   ,   so   far   as   the   generation   of   I   Logic   and   Conversation   47   implicatures   is   concerned   it   seems   to   play   a   role   not   totally   different   <br> </br>
   from   the   other   maxims   ,   and   it   will   be   convenient   ,   for   the   present   at   least   ,   to   treat   it   as   a   member   of   the   list   of   maxims   .   There   are   ,   of   course   ,   all   sorts   of   <br> </br>
   other   maxims   (   aesthetic   ,   social   ,   or   moral   in   character   )   ,   such   as   Be   polite   ,   that   are   also   nom1ally   observed   by   participants   in   talk   exchanges   ,   and   these   <br> </br>
   may   also   generate   nonconventional   implicatures   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   conversational   maxims   ,   however   ,   and   the   conversational   implicatures   connected   with   them   ,   are   specially   connected   (   I   hope   )   with   the   particular   <br> </br>
   purposes   that   talk   (   and   so   ,   talk   exchange   )   is   adapted   lo   serve   and   is   prilllarily   employed   to   serve   .   I   have   stated   my   maxims   as   if   this   purpose   were   a   <br> </br>
   maximally   effective   exchange   of   information   this   specification   is   ,   of   course   ,   too   narrow   ,   and   the   scheme   needs   to   be   generalized   to   allow   for   such   <br> </br>
   general   purposes   as   influencing   or   directing   the   actions   of   others   .   As   one   of   my   avowed   aims   is   to   see   talking   as   a   special   case   or   variety   of   purposive   ,   <br> </br>
   indeed   rational   ,   behavior   ,   it   may   be   worth   noting   that   the   specific   expectations   or   presumptions   connected   with   at   least   some   of   the   foregoing   maxims   <br> </br>
   have   their   analogues   in   the   sphere   of   transactions   that   are   not   talk   exchanges   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   list   briefly   one   such   analog   for   each   conversational   category   .   1   .   Quantity   .   If   you   are   assisting   me   to   mend   a   car   ,   I   expect   your   contribution   to   be   neither   <br> </br>
   more   nor   less   than   is   required   if   ,   for   example   ,   at   a   particular   stage   I   need   four   screws   ,   I   expect   you   to   hand   me   four   ,   rather   than   two   or   six   .   2   .   Quality   .   I   <br> </br>
   expect   your   contributions   to   be   genuine   and   not   spurious   .   If   I   need   sugar   as   an   ingredient   in   the   cake   you   are   assisting   me   to   make   ,   I   do   not   expect   you   to   hand   <br> </br>
   me   salt   if   I   need   a   spoon   ,   I   do   not   expect   a   trick   spoon   made   of   rubber   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   3   .   Relation   .   I   expect   a   partners   contribution   to   be   appropriate   to   immediate   needs   at   each   stage   of   the   transaction   if   I   am   mixing   ingredients   for   a   cake   ,   I   <br> </br>
   do   not   expect   to   be   handed   a   good   book   ,   or   even   an   oven   cloth   (   though   this   might   be   an   appropriate   contribution   at   a   later   stage   )   .   4   .   Manner   .   I   expect   a   partner   <br> </br>
   to   make   it   clear   what   contribution   he   is   making   ,   and   to   execute   his   performance   with   reasonable   dispatch   .   These   analogies   are   relevant   to   what   I   regard   as   a   <br> </br>
   fundamental   question   about   the   CP   and   its   attendant   maxims   ,   namely   ,   what   the   basis   is   for   the   assumption   which   we   seem   to   make   ,   and   on   which   (   I   hope   )   it   will   <br> </br>
   appear   that   a   great   range   of   implicatures   depend   ,   that   talkers   will   in   general   (   ceteris   paribus   and   in   the   absence   of   indica-   ..   tions   to   the   contrary   )   <br> </br>
   proceed   in   the   manner   that   these   principles   prescribe   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A   dull   but   ,   no   doubt   at   a   certain   level   , </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> adequate   answer   is   that   it   is   just   a   well-recognized   empirical   fact   that   people   DO   behave   in   these   ways   they   have </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> learned   to   do   so   in   childhood   and   not   lost   the   habit   of   doing   so   and   ,   indeed   ,   it   would   involve   a   good   deal   of   effort   to   make   a   radical   departure   from   the   habit </span>  .   <br> </br>
   It   is   much   easier   ,   for   example   ,   to   tell   the   truth   than   to   invent   lies   .   I   am   ,   however   ,   enough   of   a   rationalist   to   want   to   find   a   basis   that   underlies   these   facts   <br> </br>
   ,   undeniable   though   they   may   be   I   would   like   to   be   able   to   think   of   the   standard   type   of   conversational   practice   not   merely   as   something   that   all   or   most   do   IN   <br> </br>
   FACT   follow   but   as   something   that   it   is   HEASONAllLE   for   us   to   follow   ,   that   we   SHOULD   NOT   abandon   .   For   a   time   ,   I   was   attracted   by   the   idea   that   observance   of   the   <br> </br>
   CP   and   the   maxims   ,   in   a   talk   exchange   ,   could   be   thought   of   as   a   quasi-contractual   matter   ,   with   parallels   outside   the   realm   of   discourse   .
