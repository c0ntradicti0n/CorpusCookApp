   recording   or   by   any   informational   storage   and   retrieval   system   ,   without   written   permission   from   the   copyright   owner   .   We   live   in   a   society   which   sets   <br> </br>
   great   store   by   science   .   Scientific   experts   play   a   privileged   role   in   many   of   our   institutions   ,   ranging   from   the   courts   of   law   to   the   corridors   of   power   .   At   a   <br> </br>
   more   fundamental   level   ,   most   of   us   strive   to   shape   our   beliefs   about   the   natural   world   in   the   scientific   image   .   If   scientists   say   that   continents   move   or   <br> </br>
   that   the   universe   is   billions   of   years   old   ,   we   generally   believe   them   ,   however   counter-intuitive   and   implausible   their   claims   might   appear   to   be   .   <br> </br>
   Equally   ,   we   tend   to   acquiesce   in   what   scientists   tell   us   not   to   believe   .   If   ,   for   instance   ,   scientists   say   that   Velikovsky   was   a   crank   ,   that   the   biblical   <br> </br>
   creation   story   is   hokum   ,   that   UFOs   do   not   exist   ,   or   that   acupuncture   is   ineffective   ,   then   we   generally   make   the   scientists   contempt   for   these   things   our   <br> </br>
   own   ,   reserving   for   them   those   social   sanctions   and   disapprobations   which   are   the   just   deserts   of   quacks   ,   charlatans   and   con-men   .   In   sum   ,   much   of   our   <br> </br>
   intellectual   life   ,   and   increasingly   large   portions   of   our   social   and   political   life   ,   rest   on   the   assumption   that   we   (   or   ,   if   not   we   ourselves   ,   then   someone   <br> </br>
   whom   we   trust   in   these   matters   )   can   tell   the   difference   between   science   and   its   counterfeit   .   For   a   variety   of   historical   and   logical   reasons   ,   some   going   <br> </br>
   back   more   than   two   millennia   ,   that   to   whom   we   turn   to   find   out   the   difference   usually   happens   to   be   the   philosopher   .   Indeed   ,   it   would   not   be   going   too   far   to   <br> </br>
   say   that   ,   for   a   very   long   time   ,   philosophers   have   been   regarded   as   the   gatekeepers   to   the   scientific   estate   .   They   are   the   ones   who   are   supposed   to   be   able   to   <br> </br>
   tell   the   difference   between   real   science   and   pseudo-science   .   In   the   familiar   academic   scheme   of   things   ,   it   is   specifically   the   theorists   of   knowledge   <br> </br>
   and   the   philosophers   of   science   who   are   charged   with   arbitrating   and   legitimating   the   claims   of   any   sect   to   scientific   status   .   It   is   small   wonder   ,   under   <br> </br>
   the   circumstances   ,   that   the   question   of   the   nature   of   science   has   loomed   so   large   in   Western   philosophy   .   From   Plato   to   Popper   ,   philosophers   have   sought   to   <br> </br>
   identify   those   epistemic   features   which   mark   off   science   from   other   sorts   of   belief   and   activity   .   Nonetheless   ,   it   seems   pretty   clear   that   philosophy   has   <br> </br>
   largely   failed   to   deliver   the   relevant   goods   .   Whatever   the   specific   strengths   and   deficiencies   of   111   the   numerous   well-known   efforts   at   demarcation   (   <br> </br>
   several   of   which   will   be   discussed   below   )   ,   it   is   probably   fair   to   say   that   there   is   no   demarcation   line   between   science   and   non-science   ,   or   between   science   <br> </br>
   and   pseudo-science   ,   which   would   win   assent   from   a   majority   of   philosophers   .   Nor   is   there   one   which   should   win   acceptance   from   philosophers   or   anyone   else   <br> </br>
   but   more   of   that   below   .   What   lessons   are   we   to   draw   from   the   recurrent   failure   of   philosophy   to   detect   the   epistemic   traits   which   mark   science   off   from   other   <br> </br>
   systems   of   belief   ?   That   failure   might   conceivably   be   due   simply   to   our   impoverished   philosophical   imagination   it   is   conceivable   ,   after   all   ,   that   <br> </br>
   science   really   is   sui   generis   ,   and   that   we   philosophers   have   just   not   yet   hit   on   its   characteristic   features   .   Alternatively   ,   it   may   just   be   that   there   are   <br> </br>
   no   epistemic   features   which   all   and   only   the   diSCiplines   we   accept   as   scientific   share   in   common   .   My   aim   in   this   paper   is   to   make   a   brief   excursion   into   the   <br> </br>
   history   of   the   sciencenon-science   demarcation   in   order   to   see   what   light   it   might   shed   on   the   contemporary   viability   of   the   quest   for   a   demarcation   device   <br> </br>
   .   As   far   back   as   the   time   of   Parmenides   ,   Western   philosophers   thOUght   it   important   to   distinguish   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> knowledge </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   episteme   ) </span>  <br> </br>

   from   appearance   ,   truth   from   error   .   By   the   time   of   Aristotle   ,   these   epistemic   concerns   came   to   be   focussed   on   the   question   of   the   nature   of   scientific   <br> </br>
   knowledge   .   In   his   highly   influential   Posterior   Analytics   ,   Aristotle   described   at   length   what   was   involved   in   having   scientific   knowledge   of   something   <br> </br>
   .   To   be   scientific   ,   he   said   ,   one   must   deal   with   causes   ,   one   must   use   logical   demonstrations   ,   and   one   must   identify   the   universals   which   inhere   in   the   <br> </br>
   particulars   of   sense   .   But   above   all   ,   to   have   science   one   must   have   apodictic   certainty   .   It   is   this   last   feature   which   ,   for   Aristotle   ,   most   clearly   <br> </br>
   distinguished   the   scientific   way   of   knowing   .   <br> </br>

   .   Coming   out   of   Aristotles   work   ,   then   ,   is   a   pair   of   demarcation   criteria   .   Science   is   distinguished   from   opinion   and   superstition   by   the   certainty   of   its   <br> </br>
   principles   it   is   marked   off   from   the   crafts   by   its   comprehension   of   first   causes   .   This   set   of   contrasts   comes   to   dominate   discussions   of   the   nature   of   <br> </br>
   science   throughout   the   later   Middle   Ages   and   the   Renaissance   ,   and   thus   to   proVide   a   crucial   backdrop   to   the   re-examination   of   these   issues   in   the   <br> </br>
   seventeenth   century   .   It   is   instructive   to   see   how   this   approach   worked   in   practice   .   One   of   the   most   revealing   examples   is   provided   by   pre-modern   <br> </br>
   astronomy   .   By   the   time   of   Ptolemy   ,   mathematical   astronomers   had   largely   abandoned   the   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   Aristotelian   ) </span>  <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   tradition   of   seeking   to   derive   an   account   of   planetary   motion   from   the   causes   or   essences   of   the   planetary   material   .   As   Duhem   and   others   have   shown   in   great   <br> </br>
   detail   ,   1   many   astronomers   sought   simply   to   correlate   planetary   motions   ,   independently   of   any   causal   assumptions   about   the   essence   or   first   principles   <br> </br>
   of   the   heavens   .   Straightaway   ,   this   turned   them   from   scientists   into   craftsmen.2   To   make   matters   worse   ,   astronomers   used   a   technique   of   post   hoc   testing   <br> </br>
   of   their   theories   .   Rather   than   deriving   their   models   from   directly-intuited   first   principles   ,   they   offered   hypothetical   constructions   of   planetary   <br> </br>
   motions   and   positions   and   then   compared   the   predictions   drawn   from   their   models   with   the   observed   positions   of   the   heavenly   bodies   .    [missing index]   <br> </br>

   The   central   point   for   our   purposes   is   that   ,   by   abandoning   a   demonstrative   method   based   on   necessary   first   principles   ,   the   astronomers   were   indulging   in   <br> </br>
   mere   opinion   rather   than   knowledge   ,   putting   themselves   well   beyond   the   scientific   pale   .   Through   virtually   the   whole   of   the   Middle   and   indeed   up   until   the   <br> </br>
   beginning   of   the   seventeenth   century   ,   the   predominant   view   of   mathematical   astronomy   was   that   ,   for   the   reasons   indicated   ,   it   did   not   qualify   as   a   science   <br> </br>
   .   (   It   is   worth   noting   in   passing   that   much   of   the   furor   caused   by   the   astronomical   work   of   Copernicus   and   Kepler   was   a   result   of   the   fact   that   they   were   <br> </br>
   claiming   to   make   astronomy   scientific   again   .   )   More   generally   ,   the   seventeenth   century   brought   a   very   deep   shift   in   demarcationist   sensibilities   .   To   <br> </br>
   make   a   long   and   fascinating   story   unconscionably   brief   ,   we   can   say   that   most   seventeenth   century   thinkers   accepted   Aristotles   first   demarcation   <br> </br>
   criterion   (   viz   .   ,   between   infallible   science   and   fallible   opinion   )   ,   but   rejected   his   second   (   between   know-how   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> and   understanding   ) </span>  <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   .   For   instance   ,   if   we   look   to   the   work   of   Galileo   ,   Huygens   or   Newton   ,   we   see   a   refusal   to   prefer   know-why   to   know-how   indeed   ,   all   three   were   prepared   to   regard   <br> </br>
   as   entirely   scientific   ,   systems   of   belief   which   laid   no   claim   to   an   understanding   grounded   in   primary   causes   or   essences   .   Thus   Galileo   claimed   to   know   <br> </br>
   little   or   nothing   about   the   underlying   causes   responsible   for   the   free   fall   of   bodies   ,   and   in   his   own   science   of   kinematics   he   steadfastly   refused   to   <br> </br>
   speculate   about   such   matters   .   But   Galileo   believed   that   he   could   still   sustain   his   claim   to   be   developing   a   science   of   motion   because   the   results   he   <br> </br>
   reached   were   ,   so   he   claimed   ,   infallible   and   demonstrative   .   Similarly   ,   Newton   in   Principia   was   not   indifferent   to   causal   explanation   ,   and   freely   <br> </br>
   admitted   that   he   would   like   to   know   the   causes   of   gravitational   phenomena   but   he   was   emphatic   that   ,   even   without   a   knowledge   of   the   causes   of   gravity   ,   one   <br> </br>
   can   engage   in   a   sophisticated   and   scientific   account   of   the   gravitational   behavior   of   the   heavenly   bodies   .   As   with   Galileo   ,   Newton   regarded   his   <br> </br>
   non-causal   account   as   scientifical   because   of   the   (   avowed   )   certainty   of   its   conclusions   .   As   Newton   told   his   readers   over   and   again   ,   he   did   not   engage   in   <br> </br>
   hypotheses   and   speculations   :   he   purported   to   be   deriving   his   theories   directly   from   the   phenomena   .   Here   again   ,   the   infallibility   of   results   ,   rather   <br> </br>
   than   their   derivability   from   first   causes   ,   comes   to   be   the   single   touchstone   of   scientific   status   .   Despite   the   divergence   of   approach   among   thinkers   of   <br> </br>
   the   seventeenth   and   eighteenth   centuries   ,   there   is   widespread   agreement   that   scientific   knowledge   is   apodictically   certain   .   And   this   consensus   cuts   <br> </br>
   across   most   of   the   usual   epistemological   divides   of   the   period   .   For   instance   ,   Bacon   ,   Locke   ,   Leibniz   ,   Descartes   ,   Newton   and   Kant   are   in   accord   about   this   <br> </br>
   way   of   characterizing   science.3   They   may   disagree   about   how   precisely   to   certify   the   certainty   of   knowledge   ,   but   none   quarrels   with   the   claim   that   <br> </br>
   science   and   infallible   knowledge   are   co-terminous   .   As   I   have   shown   elsewhere,4   this   influential   account   fmally   and   decisively   came   unraveled   in   the   <br> </br>
   nineteenth   century   with   the   emergence   and   eventual   triumph   of   a   fallibilistic   perspective   in   epistemology   .   Once   one   accepts   ,   as   most   thinkers   had   by   the   <br> </br>
   mid-nineteenth   century   ,   that   science   offers   no   apodictic   certainty   ,   that   all   scientific   theories   are   corrigible   and   may   be   subject   to   serious   <br> </br>
   emendation   ,   then   it   is   no   longer   viable   to   attempt   to   distinguish   science   from   non-science   by   assimilating   that   distinction   to   the   difference   between   <br> </br>
   knowledge   and   opinion   .   Indeed   ,   the   unambiguous   implication   of   fallibilism   is   that   there   is   no   difference   between   knowledge   and   opinion   :   within   a   <br> </br>
   fallibilist   framework   ,   scientific   belief   turns   out   to   be   just   a   species   of   the   genus   opinion   .   Several   nineteenth   century   philosophers   of   science   tried   <br> </br>
   to   take   some   of   the   sting   out   of   this   volte-face   by   suggesting   that   scientific   opinions   were   more   probable   or   more   reliable   than   non-scientific   ones   but   <br> </br>
   even   they   conceded   that   it   was   no   longer   possible   to   make   infallibility   the   hallmark   of   scientific   knowledge   .   With   certainty   no   longer   available   as   the   <br> </br>
   demarcation   tool   ,   nineteenth   century   philosophers   and   scientists   quickly   forged   other   tools   to   do   the   job   .   Thinkers   as   diverse   as   Comte   ,   Bain   ,   Jevons   ,   <br> </br>
   Helmholtz   and   Mach   (   to   name   only   a   few   )   began   to   insist   that   what   really   marks   science   off   from   everything   else   is   its   methodology   .   There   was   ,   they   <br> </br>
   maintained   ,   something   called   the   scientific   method   even   if   that   method   was   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> not   fool-proof </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   the   acceptance   of   fallibilism   demanded </span>  <br> </br>

   that   concession   )   ,   it   was   at   least   a   better   technique   for   testing   empirical   claims   than   any   other   .   And   if   it   did   make   mistakes   ,   it   was   sufficiently   <br> </br>
   self-corrective   that   it   would   soon   discover   them   and   put   them   right   .   As   one   writer   remarked   a   few   years   later   :   if   science   lead   us   astray   ,   more   science   will   <br> </br>
   set   us   straight.5   One   need   hardly   add   that   the   nineteenth   century   did   not   invent   the   idea   of   a   logic   of   scientific   inquiry   that   dates   back   at   least   to   <br> </br>
   Aristotle   .   But   the   new   insistence   in   this   period   is   on   a   fallible   method   which   ,   for   all   its   fallibility   ,   is   nonetheless   superior   to   its   non-scientific   <br> </br>
   rivals   .   This   effort   to   mark   science   off   from   other   things   required   one   to   show   two   things   .   First   ,   that   the   various   activities   regarded   as   science   utilized   <br> </br>
   essentially   the   same   repertoire   of   methods   (   hence   the   importance   in   the   period   of   the   so-called   thesis   of   the   unity   of   method   )   secondly   ,   the   epistemic   <br> </br>
   credentials   of   this   method   had   to   be   established   .   At   first   blush   ,   this   program   of   identifying   science   with   a   certain   technique   of   inquiry   is   not   a   silly   one   <br> </br>
   indeed   ,   it   still   persists   in   some   respectable   circles   even   in   our   time   .   But   the   nineteenth   century   could   not   begin   to   deliver   on   the   two   requirements   just   <br> </br>
   mentioned   because   there   was   no   agreement   about   what   the   scientific   method   was   .   Some   took   it   to   be   the   canons   of   inductive   reasoning   sketched   out   by   <br> </br>
   Herschel   and   Mill   .   Others   insisted   that   the   basic   methodological   principle   of   science   was   that   its   theories   must   be   restricted   to   observable   116   <br> </br>
   entities   (   the   nineteenth   century   requirement   of   vera   causa).6   Still   others   ,   like   Whewell   and   Peirce   ,   rejected   the   search   for   verae   causae   altogether   <br> </br>
   and   argued   that   the   only   decisive   methodological   test   of   a   theory   involved   its   ability   successfully   to   make   surprising   predictions   .   Absent   agreement   on   <br> </br>
   what   the   scientific   method   amounted   to   ,   demarcationists   were   scarcely   in   a   position   to   argue   persuasively   that   what   individuated   science   was   its   method   <br> </br>
   .   This   approach   was   further   embarrassed   by   a   notorious   set   of   ambiguities   surrounding   several   of   its   key   components   .   Specifically   ,   many   of   the   meth-   <br> </br>
   odological   rules   proposed   were   much   too   ambiguous   for   one   to   tell   when   they   were   being   followed   and   when   breached   .   Thus   ,   such   common   methodo-   logical   <br> </br>
   rules   as   avoid   ad   hoc   hypotheses   ,   postulate   simple   theories   ,   feign   no   hypotheses   ,   and   eschew   theoretical   entities   involved   complex   conceptions   which   <br> </br>
   neither   scientists   nor   philosophers   of   the   period   were   willing   to   explicate   .   To   exacerbate   matters   still   further   ,   what   most   philoso-   phers   of   science   of   <br> </br>
   the   period   offered   up   as   an   account   of   the   scientific   method   bore   little   resemblance   to   the   methods   actually   used   by   working   scientists   ,   a   point   made   with   <br> </br>
   devastating   clarity   by   Pierre   Duhem   in   1908   .   8   As   one   can   see   ,   the   situation   by   the   late   nineteenth   century   was   more   than   a   little   ironic   .   At   precisely   that   <br> </br>
   juncture   when   science   was   beginning   to   have   a   decisive   impact   on   the   lives   and   institutions   of   Western   man   ,   at   precisely   that   time   when   scientism   (   Le   .   ,   <br> </br>

   otherwise   suggest   .   It   is   true   ,   of   course   ,   that   there   was   still   much   talk   about   the   scientific   method   and   doubtless   many   hoped   that   the   methods   of   science   <br> </br>
   could   play   the   demar-   cationist   role   formerly   assigned   to   certainty   .   But   ,   leaving   aside   the   fact   that   agreement   was   lacking   about   precisely   what   the   <br> </br>
   scientific   method   was   ,   there   was   no   good   reason   as   yet   to   prefer   anyone   of   the   proposed   scientific   methods   to   any   purportedly   non-scientific   ones   ,   since   <br> </br>
   no   one   had   managed   to   show   either   that   any   of   the   candidate   scientific   methods   qualified   them   as   knowledge   (   in   the   traditional   sense   of   the   term   )   or   ,   even   <br> </br>
   more   minimally   ,   that   those   methods   were   epistemically   superior   to   their   rivals   .   Before   we   move   to   consider   and   to   assess   some   familiar   demarcationist   <br> </br>
   proposals   from   our   own   epoch   ,   we   need   to   engage   briefly   in   certain   metaphilosophical   preliminaries   .   Specifically   ,   we   should   ask   three   central   <br> </br>
   questions   :   (   1   )   What   conditions   of   adequacy   should   a   proposed   demarcation   criterion   satisfy   ?   (   2   )   Is   the   criterion   under   consideration   offering   <br> </br>
   necessary   or   sufficient   conditions   ,   or   both   ,   for   scientific   status   ?   (   3   )   What   actions   or   judgments   are   implied   by   the   claim   that   a   certain   belief   or   <br> </br>
   activity   is   scientific   or   unscientific   ?   (   1   )   Early   in   the   history   of   thought   it   was   inevitable   that   characterizations   of   science   and   knowledge   would   be   <br> </br>
   largely   stipulative   and   a   priori   .   After   all   ,   until   as   late   as   the   seventeenth   century   ,   there   were   few   developed   examples   of   empirical   sciences   which   one   <br> </br>
   could   point   to   or   whose   properties   one   could   study   under   such   circumstances   ,   where   one   is   working   largely   ab   initio   ,   one   can   be   uncompromisingly   <br> </br>
   legislative   about   how   a   term   like   science   or   knowledge   will   be   used   .   But   as   the   sciences   developed   and   prospered   ,   philosophers   began   to   see   the   task   of   <br> </br>
   formulating   a   demarcation   criterion   as   no   longer   a   purely   stipulative   undertaking   .   Any   proposed   dividing   line   between   science   and   non-science   would   <br> </br>
   have   to   be   (   at   least   in   part   )   explicative   and   thus   sensitive   to   existing   patterns   of   usage   .   Accordingly   ,   if   one   were   today   to   offer   a   defmition   of   science   <br> </br>
   which   classified   (   say   )   the   major   theories   of   physics   and   chemistry   as   non-scientific   ,   one   would   thereby   have   failed   to   reconstruct   some   paradigmatic   <br> </br>
   cases   of   the   use   of   the   term   .   Where   Plato   or   Aristotle   need   not   have   worried   if   some   or   even   most   of   the   intellectual   activities   of   their   time   failed   to   <br> </br>
   satisfy   their   respective   definitions   of   science   ,   it   is   inconceivable   that   we   would   fmd   a   demarcation   criterion   satisfactory   which   relegated   to   <br> </br>
   unscientific   status   a   large   number   of   the   activities   we   consider   scientific   or   which   admitted   as   sciences   activities   which   seem   to   us   decidedly   <br> </br>
   unscientific   .
