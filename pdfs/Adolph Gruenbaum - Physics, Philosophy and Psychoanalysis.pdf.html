   ,   For   a   variety   of   historical   and   logical   reasons   ,   some   going   back   more   than   two   millennia   ,   that   to   whom   we   turn   to   find   out   the   difference   usually   happens   to   <br> </br>
   be   the   philosopher   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Indeed   ,   it   would   not   be   going   too   far   to   say   that   ,   for   a   very   long   time   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> philosophers </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> have   been   regarded   as   the   gatekeepers   to   the   scientific   estate </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   are   the   ones   who   are   supposed   to   be   able   to   tell   the   difference   between   real   science   and   pseudo-science   .   In   the   familiar   academic   scheme   of   things   ,   it   <br> </br>
   is   specifically   the   theorists   of   knowledge   and   the   philosophers   of   science   who   are   charged   with   arbitrating   and   legitimating   the   claims   of   any   sect   to   <br> </br>
   scientific   status   .   It   is   small   wonder   ,   under   the   circumstances   ,   that   the   question   of   the   nature   of   science   has   loomed   so   large   in   Western   philosophy   .   From   <br> </br>
   Plato   to   Popper   ,   philosophers   have   sought   to   identify   those   epistemic   features   which   mark   off   science   from   other   sorts   of   belief   and   activity   .   <br> </br>
   Nonetheless   ,   it   seems   pretty   clear   that   philosophy   has   largely   failed   to   deliver   the   relevant   goods   .   Whatever   the   specific   strengths   and   deficiencies   <br> </br>
   of   the   numerous   well-known   efforts   at   demarcation   (   several   of   which   will   be   discussed   below   )   ,   it   is   probably   fair   to   say   that   there   is   no   demarcation   line   <br> </br>
   between   science   and   non-science   ,   or   between   science   and   pseudo-science   ,   which   would   win   assent   from   a   majority   of   philosophers   .   Nor   is   there   one   which   <br> </br>
   should   win   acceptance   from   philosophers   or   anyone   else   ;   but   more   of   that   below   .   But   Aristotle   sometimes   offered   a   second   demarcation   criterion   ,   <br> </br>
   orthogonal   to   this   one   between   science   and   opinion   .   <br> </br>

   noting   in   passing   that   much   of   the   furor   caused   by   the   astronomical   work   of   Copernicus   and   Kepler   was   a   result   of   the   fact   that   they   were   claiming   to   make   <br> </br>
   astronomy   scientific   again   .   )   More   generally   ,   the   seventeenth   century   brought   a   very   deep   shift   in   demarcationist   sensibilities   .   To   make   a   long   and   <br> </br>
   fascinating   story   unconscionably   brief   ,   we   can   say   that   most   seventeenth   century   thinkers   accepted   Aristotles   first   demarcation   criterion   (   viz   .   ,   <br> </br>
   between   infallible   science   and   fallible   opinion   )   ,   but   rejected   his   second   (   between   know-how   and   understanding   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   instance   ,   if   we   look   to   the   work   of   Galileo   ,   Huygens   or   Newton   ,   we   see   a   refusal   to   prefer   know-why   to   know-how   ;   indeed   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> all   three </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> were   prepared   to   regard </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as   entirely   scientific   ,   systems   of   belief   which   laid   no   claim   to   an   understanding   grounded   in   primary   causes   or   essences </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   Galileo   claimed   to   know   little   or   nothing   about   the   underlying   causes   responsible   for   the   free   fall   of   bodies   ,   and   in   his   own   science   of   kinematics   he   <br> </br>
   steadfastly   refused   to   speculate   about   such   matters   .   But   Galileo   believed   that   he   could   still   sustain   his   claim   to   be   developing   a   science   of   motion   <br> </br>
   because   the   results   he   reached   were   ,   so   he   claimed   ,   infallible   and   demonstrative   .   Similarly   ,   Newton   in   Principia   was   not   indifferent   to   causal   <br> </br>
   explanation   ,   and   freely   admitted   that   he   would   like   to   know   the   causes   of   gravitational   phenomena   ;   but   he   was   emphatic   that   ,   even   without   a   knowledge   of   <br> </br>
   the   causes   of   gravity   ,   one   can   engage   in   a   sophisticated   and   scientific   account   of   the   gravitational   behavior   of   the   heavenly   bodies   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> As   with </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Galileo </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   Newton   regarded   his   non-causal   account   as   scientifical   because   of   the   (   avowed   )   certainty   of   its   conclusions </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   Newton   told   his   readers   over   and   again   ,   he   did   not   engage   in   hypotheses   and   speculations   :   he   purported   to   be   deriving   his   theories   directly   from   the   <br> </br>
   phenomena   .   Here   again   ,   the   infallibility   of   results   ,   rather   than   their   derivability   from   first   causes   ,   comes   to   be   the   single   touchstone   of   scientific   <br> </br>
   status   .   Despite   the   divergence   of   approach   among   thinkers   of   the   seventeenth   and   eighteenth   centuries   ,   there   is   widespread   agreement   that   scientific   <br> </br>
   knowledge   is   apodictically   certain   .   And   this   consensus   cuts   across   most   of   the   usual   epistemological   divides   of   the   period   .   For   instance   ,   Bacon   ,   Locke   ,   <br> </br>
   Leibniz   ,   Descartes   ,   Newton   and   Kant   are   in   accord   about   this   way   of   characterizing   science.3   They   may   disagree   about   how   precisely   to   certify   the   <br> </br>
   certainty   of   knowledge   ,   but   none   quarrels   with   the   claim   that   science   and   infallible   knowledge   are   co-terminous   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   I   have   shown   elsewhere,4   this   influential   account   fmally   and   decisively   came   unraveled   in   the   nineteenth   century   with   the   emergence   and   eventual   <br> </br>
   triumph   of   a   fallibilistic   perspective   in   epistemology   .   Once   one   accepts   ,   as   With   certainty   no   longer   available   as   the   demarcation   tool   ,   nineteenth   <br> </br>
   century   philosophers   and   scientists   quickly   forged   other   tools   to   do   the   job   .   Thinkers   as   diverse   as   Comte   ,   Bain   ,   Jevons   ,   Helmholtz   and   Mach   (   to   name   only   <br> </br>
   a   few   )   began   to   insist   that   what   really   marks   science   off   from   everything   else   is   its   methodology   .   There   was   ,   they   maintained   ,   something   called   the   <br> </br>
   scientific   method   ;   even   if   that   method   was   not   fool-proof   (   the   acceptance   of   fallibilism   demanded   that   concession   )   ,   it   was   at   least   a   better   technique   <br> </br>
   for   testing   empirical   claims   than   any   other   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   And   if   it   did   make   mistakes   ,   it   was   sufficiently   self-corrective   that   it   would   soon   discover   them   and   put   them   right   .   <br> </br>

   scientific   inquiry   ;   that   dates   back   at   least   to   Aristotle   .   But   the   new   insistence   in   this   period   is   on   a   fallible   method   which   ,   for   all   its   fallibility   ,   is   <br> </br>
   nonetheless   superior   to   its   non-scientific   rivals   .   entities   (   the   nineteenth   century   requirement   of   vera   causa).6   Still   others   ,   argued   that   the   only   <br> </br>
   decisive   methodological   test   of   a   theory   involved   its   what   the   scientific   method   amounted   to   ,   demarcationists   were   scarcely   in   a   position   to   argue   <br> </br>
   persuasively   that   what   individuated   science   was   its   method   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   approach   was   further   embarrassed   by   a   notorious   set   of   ambiguities   surrounding   several   of   its   key   components   .   Specifically   ,   many   of   the   meth-   they   <br> </br>
   were   being   followed   and   when   breached   .   Thus   ,   such   common   methodo-   logical   rules   as   avoid   ad   hoc   hypotheses   ,   postulate   simple   theories   ,   feign   no   <br> </br>
   hypotheses   ,   and   eschew   theoretical   entities   involved   complex   phers   of   science   of   the   period   offered   up   as   an   account   of   the   scientific   method   bore   little   <br> </br>
   resemblance   to   the   methods   actually   used   by   working   scientists   ,   a   point   made   with   devastating   clarity   by   Pierre   Duhem   in   1908   .   As   one   can   see   ,   the   <br> </br>
   situation   by   the   late   nineteenth   century   was   more   than   a   little   ironic   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   At   precisely   that   juncture   when   science   was   beginning   to   have   a   decisive   impact   on   the   lives   and   institutions   of   Western   man   ,   at  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> alone </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> has   the   answers   to   all </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> our   answerable   questions   )   was   gaining   ground   ,   in   all   manner   of   pseudo-scientists   (   e.g.   ,   homeopathic   physicians   ,   spiritualists   ,   selves   empty-handed </span>  <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Except   at   the   rhetorical   level   ,   there   was   no   longer   any   consensus   about   what   separated   science   from   anything   else   .   Surprisingly   (   or   ,   if   one   is   cynically   <br> </br>
   inclined   ,   quite   expectedly   )   ,   the   absence   of   a   plausible   demarcation   criterion   did   not   stop   fin   de   siecle   scientists   and   than   their   confident   <br> </br>
   denunciations   of   quackery   might   otherwise   suggest   .   It   is   true   ,   of   course   ,   that   there   was   still   much   talk   about   the   scientific   method   ;   and   doubtless   many   <br> </br>
   hoped   that   the   methods   of   science   could   play   the   demar-   cationist   role   formerly   assigned   to   certainty   .   But   ,   leaving   aside   the   fact   that   agreement   was   <br> </br>
   lacking   about   precisely   what   the   scientific   method   was   ,   there   methods   to   any   purportedly   non-scientific   ones   ,   since   no   one   had   managed   to   show   either   <br> </br>
   that   any   of   the   candidate   scientific   methods   qualified   them   as   knowledge   (   in   the   traditional   sense   of   the   term   )   or   ,   even   more   minimally   ,   that   those   <br> </br>
   methods   were   epistemically   superior   to   their   rivals   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   1   )   Early   in   the   history   of   thought   it   was   inevitable   that   characterizations   of   science   and   knowledge   would   be   largely   stipulative   and   a   priori   .   After   all   <br> </br>
   ,   until   as   late   as   the   seventeenth   century   ,   there   were   few   developed   examples   of   empirical   sciences   which   one   could   point   to   or   whose   properties   one   could   <br> </br>
   study   ;   under   such   circumstances   ,   where   one   is   working   largely   ab   initio   ,   one   can   be   uncompromisingly   legislative   about   how   a   term   like   science   or   <br> </br>
   knowledge   will   be   used   .   But   as   the   sciences   developed   and   prospered   ,   philosophers   began   to   see   the   task   of   formulating   a   demarcation   criterion   as   no   <br> </br>
   longer   a   purely   stipulative   undertaking   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Any   proposed   dividing   line   between   science   and   non-science   would   have   to   be   (   at   least   in   part   )   explicative   and   thus   sensitive   to   existing   patterns   of   <br> </br>
   usage   .   Accordingly   ,   if   one   were   today   to   offer   a   defmition   of   science   which   classified   (   say   )   the   major   theories   of   physics   and   chemistry   as   <br> </br>
   non-scientific   ,   one   would   thereby   have   failed   to   reconstruct   some   paradigmatic   cases   of   the   use   of   the   term   .   Where   Plato   or   Aristotle   need   not   have   <br> </br>
   worried   if   some   or   even   most   of   the   intellectual   activities   of   their   time   failed   to   satisfy   their   respective   definitions   of   science   ,   it   is   inconceivable   <br> </br>
   that   we   would   fmd   a   demarcation   criterion   satisfactory   which   relegated   to   unscientific   status   a   large   number   of   the   activities   we   consider   scientific   or   <br> </br>
   which   admitted   as   sciences   activities   which   seem   to   us   decidedly   unscientific   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   other   words   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> quest </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> for   a </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> latter-day   demarcation   criterion </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> involves   an   attempt   to   render   explicit   those   shared   but   largely   implicit   sorting </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   (   And   it   seems   to   me   that   there   is   a   large   measure   of   agreement   at   this   paradigmatic   level   ,   even   allowing   for   the   existence   of   plenty   of   controversial   <br> </br>

   knowledge   claims   and   the   modes   of   inquiry   of   the   sciences   .   Because   there   are   doubtless   many   respects   in   which   science   differs   from   non-science   (   e.g.   ,   <br> </br>
   scientists   may   make   larger   salaries   ,   or   know   tific   matters   in   a   way   which   exhibits   a   surer   epistemic   warrant   or   evidential   ground   for   science   than   for   <br> </br>
   non-science   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   it   should   happen   that   there   is   no   such   warrant   ,   then   the   demarcation   between   science   and   non-science   would   Minimally   ,   then   ,   a   philosophical   <br> </br>
   demarcation   criterion   must   be   an   adequate   non-science   .   Additionally   ,   as   we   have   noted   before   ,   the   criterion   must   have   sufficient   precision   that   we   can   <br> </br>
   tell   whether   various   activities   and   beliefs   better   than   no   criterion   at   all   .   (   2   )   What   will   the   formal   structure   of   a   demarcation   criterion   have   to   look   <br> </br>
   like   if   it   is   to   accomplish   the   tasks   for   which   it   is   designed   ?   Ideally   ,   it   would   specify   a   set   of   individually   necessary   and   jointly   sufficient   con-   <br> </br>
   ditions   for   deciding   whether   an   activity   or   set   of   statements   is   scientific   or   unscientific   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> As </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   well   known   ,   it   has   not   proved   easy   to   produce   a   set   of   necessary   and   sufficient   conditions   for </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> science </span>  .   Would   something   less   ambitious   do   the   job   ?   It   <br> </br>

   scientific   status   .   Such   a   condition   ,   if   acceptable   ,   would   allow   us   to   identify   certain   activities   as   decidedly   unscientific   ,   but   it   would   not   help   fix   <br> </br>
   our   beliefs   ,   because   it   would   not   specify   which   systems   actually   were   scientific   .   <br> </br>

   (   3   )   Closely   related   to   this   point   is   a   broader   question   of   the   purposes   behind   the   formulation   of   a   demarcation   criterion   .   No   one   can   look   at   the   history   of   <br> </br>
   debates   between   scientists   and   pseudo-scientists   without   realizing   that   demarcation   criteria   are   typically   used   as   machines   de   guerre   in   a   polemical   <br> </br>
   battle   between   rival   camps   .   Indeed   ,   many   of   those   most   closely   associated   with   the   demarcation   issue   have   evidently   had   hidden   (   and   sometimes   not   so   <br> </br>
   hidden   )   agendas   of   various   sorts   .   It   is   well   known   ,   for   instance   ,   that   Aristotle   was   concerned   to   embarrass   the   practitioners   of   Hippocratic   medicine   ;   <br> </br>
   and   it   is   notorious   that   the   logical   positivists   wanted   to   repudiate   metaphysics   and   that   Popper   was   out   to   get   Marx   and   Freud   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   every   case   ,   they   used   a   demarcation   criterion   of   their   own   devising   as   the   discrediting   device   .   merely   because   it   has   these   judgmental   implications   <br> </br>
   associated   with   it   .   Quite   the   reverse   ,   philosophy   at   its   best   should   tell   us   what   is   reasonable   to   believe   and   what   is   not   .   But   the   value-loaded   character   <br> </br>
   of   the   term   science   (   and   its   cognates   )   in   our   culture   should   make   us   realize   that   the   labelling   of   a   certain   activity   as   scientific   or   unscientific   has   <br> </br>
   social   and   political   ramifications   which   go   well   beyond   the   taxonomic   task   of   sorting   beliefs   into   two   piles   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Although   the   cleaver   that   makes   the   cut   may   be   largely   epistemic   in   character   ,   it   has   consequences   which   are   decidedly   non-epistemic   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Precisely   because </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> a </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> demarcation   criterion </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> will   serve   as   a </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> rationale </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> for   taking   a   number   of   practical   actions   which   may   well   have   far-reaching   moral   ,   social   and   economic </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> consequences   ,   it   would   be   wise   to   insist   that   the   arguments   in   favor   of   any   demarcation   criterion   we   intend   to   take   seriously   should   be   especially </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> compelling </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   With   these   preliminaries   out   of   the   way   ,   we   can   turn   to   an   examination   of   the   recent   history   of   demarcation   .   As   we   have   seen   ,   there   was   ample   reason   by   1900   to   <br> </br>
   conclude   that   neither   certainty   nor   generation   according   to   a   privileged   set   of   methodolOgical   rules   was   adequate   to   denominate   science   .   It   should   thus   <br> </br>
   come   as   no   surprise   that   philosophers   of   the   1920s   and   1930s   added   a   couple   of   new   wrinkles   to   the   problem   .   As   is   well   known   ,   several   prominent   members   of   the   <br> </br>
   Wiener   Kreis   took   a   syntactic   or   logical   approach   to   the   matter   .   If   ,   the   logical   positivists   apparently   reasoned   ,   epistemology   and   methodology   are   <br> </br>
   incapable   of   distinguishing   the   scientific   from   the   non-scientific   ,   then   perhaps   the   theory   of   meaning   will   do   the   job   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> A </span> <span class="subject level2 subject2"> statement </span> <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> ,   they   suggested   ,   was   scientific   just   in   case   it   had   a   determinate   meaning </span></span>  <br> </br>
   ;   and  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> meaningful   statements </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> were   those   which   could   be   exhaustively   verified </span>  .   As   Popper   once   observed   ,   the   positivists   thought   that   verifiability   ,   <br> </br>
   meaningfulness   ,   and   scientific   character   all   coincide   .   11   Despite   its   many   reformulations   during   the   late   1920s   and   1930s   verificationism   enjoyed   <br> </br>
   mixed   fortunes   as   a   theory   of   meaning   .   12   But   as   a   would-be   demarcation   between   the   scientific   and   the   non-scientific   ,   it   was   a   disaster   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Not   only   are   many   statements   in   the   sciences   not   open   to   exhaustive   verification   (   e.g.   ,   all   universal   laws   )   ,   but   the   vast   majority   of   non-scientific   and   <br> </br>
   pseudo-scientific   systems   of   belief   have   verifiable   constituents   .   Consider   ,   for   instance   ,   the   thesis   that   the   Earth   is   flat   .   To   subscribe   to   such   a   <br> </br>
   belief   in   the   twentieth   century   would   be   the   height   of   folly   .   Yet   such   a   statement   is   It   is   worth   pausing   for   a   moment   to   ponder   the   importance   of   this   <br> </br>
   difference   .   I   said   before   that   the   shift   from   the   older   to   the   newer   demarcationist   orientation   could   be   described   as   a   move   from   epistemic   to   syntactic   <br> </br>
   and   semantic   strategies   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   fact   ,   the   shift   is   even   more   significant   than  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> that </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> way   of   describing   the   transition   suggests </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   central   concern   of   the   older   tradition   that   they   satisfy   the   relevant   semantic   criteria   for   scientific   status   !   The   new   demarcationism   thus   reveals   <br> </br>
   itself   as   a   largely   toothless   wonder   ,   which   serves   neither   to   explicate   the   paradigmatic   usages   of   scientific   (   and   its   cognates   )   nor   to   perform   the   <br> </br>
   critical   stable-cleaning   chores   for   which   it   was   originally   intended   .   It   can   readily   be   shown   that   none   of   these   suggestions   can   be   a   necessary   and   <br> </br>
   sufficient   condition   for   something   to   count   as   science   ,   at   least   not   as   that   term   is   customarily   used   .   And   in   most   cases   ,   these   are   not   even   plausible   as   <br> </br>
   necessary   conditions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Let   me   sketch   out   some   of   the   reasons   why   these   proposals   are   so   unpromising   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Take   the   requirement   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> well-testedness </span>  .   Unfortunately   ,   we   have   no   viable   <br> </br>
   over-arching   account   of   the   circumstances   under   which   a   claim   may   be   regarded   as   well   tested   .   But   even   if   we   did   ,   is   it   plausible   to   suggest   that   all   the   <br> </br>
   assertions   in   science   texts   (   let   alone   science   journals   )   have   been   well   tested   and   that   none   of   the   assertions   in   such   conventionally   non-scientific   <br> </br>
   fields   as   literary   theory   ,   carpentry   or   football   strategy   are   well   tested   ?   When   a   scientist   presents   a   conjecture   which   has   not   yet   been   tested   and   is   such   <br> </br>
   that   we   are   not   yet   sure   what   would   count   as   a   robust   test   of   it   ,   has   that   scientist   ceased   doing   science   when   he   discusses   his   conjecture   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   On   the   other   side   of   the   divide   ,   is   anyone   prepared   to   say   that   we   have   no   convincing   evidence   for   such   non-scientific   claims   as   that   Bacon   did   not   write   the   <br> </br>
   plays   attributed   to   Shakespeare   ,   that   a   mitre   joint   is   stronger   than   a   flush   joint   ,   or   that   off-side   kicks   are   not   usually   fumbled   ?   Indeed   ,   are   we   not   <br> </br>
   entitled   to   say   that   all   these   claims   are   much   better   supported   by   the   evidence   than   many   of   the   scientific   assumptions   of   (   say   )   cosmology   or   psychology   ?   <br> </br>
   The   reason   for   this   divergence   is   simple   to   see   .   Many   ,   perhaps   most   ,   parts   of   science   are   highly   speculative   compared   with   many   non-scientific   <br> </br>
   disciplines   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   seems   good   reason   ,   given   from   the   historical   record   ,   to   suppose   that   most   scientific   theories   are   false   ;   under   the   circumstances   ,   how   plausible   <br> </br>
   can   be   the   claim   that   science   is   the   repository   of   all   and   only   reliable   or   well-confirmed   theories   ?   for   marking   off   scientific   knowledge   ,   since   many   <br> </br>
   scientific   theories   -   even   those   in   the   so-called   mature   sciences   -   do   not   contain   their   predecessors   ,   not   even   as   limiting   cases   .   I   will   not   pretend   to   be   <br> </br>
   able   to   prove   that   there   is   no   conceivable   philosophical   reconstruction   of   our   intuitive   distinction   between   the   scientific   and   the   non-scientific   .
