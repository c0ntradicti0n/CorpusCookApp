  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> to   the   corridors   of   power </span>  .   At   a   more   fundamental   level   ,   most   of   us   strive   to   shape   our   beliefs   about   the   natural   world   in   the   scientific   image   .   If   scientists   <br> </br>
   say   that   continents   move   or   that   the   universe   is   billions   of   years   old   ,   we   generally   believe   them   ,   however   counter-intuitive   and   implausible   their   <br> </br>
   claims   might   appear   to   be   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Equally   ,   we   tend   to   acquiesce   in   what   scientists   tell   us   not   to   believe   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> If   ,   for   instance   ,   scientists   say   that </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Velikovsky </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   a   crank   ,   that   the   biblical </span>  <br> </br>

   own   ,   reserving   for   them   those   social   sanctions   and   disapprobations   which   are   the   just   deserts   of   quacks   ,   charlatans   and   con-men   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   sum   ,   much   of   our   intellectual   life   ,   and   increasingly   large   portions   of   our   social   and   political   life   ,   rest   on   the   assumption   that   we   (   or   ,   if   not   we   <br> </br>
   ourselves   ,   then   someone   whom   we   trust   in   these   matters   )   can   tell   the   difference   between   science   and   its   counterfeit   .   For   a   variety   of   historical   and   <br> </br>
   logical   reasons   ,   some   going   back   more   than   two   millennia   ,   that   to   whom   we   turn   to   find   out   the   difference   usually   happens   to   be   the   philosopher   .   Indeed   ,   it   <br> </br>
   would   not   be   going   too   far   to   say   that   ,   for   a   very   long   time   ,   philosophers   have   been   regarded   as   the   gatekeepers   to   the   scientific   estate   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   are   the   ones   who   are   supposed   to   be   able   to   tell   the   difference   between   real   science   and   pseudo-science   .   In   the   familiar   academic   scheme   of   things   ,   it   <br> </br>
   is   specifically   the   theorists   of   knowledge   and   the   philosophers   of   science   who   are   charged   with   arbitrating   and   legitimating   the   claims   of   any   sect   to   <br> </br>
   scientific   status   .   It   is   small   wonder   ,   under   the   circumstances   ,   that   the   question   of   the   nature   of   science   has   loomed   so   large   in   Western   philosophy   .   From   <br> </br>
   Plato   to   Popper   ,   philosophers   have   sought   to   identify   those   epistemic   features   which   mark   off   science   from   other   sorts   of   belief   and   activity   .   <br> </br>
   Nonetheless   ,   it   seems   pretty   clear   that   philosophy   has   largely   failed   to   deliver   the   relevant   goods   .   Whatever   the   specific   strengths   and   deficiencies   <br> </br>
   of   111   the   numerous   well-known   efforts   at   demarcation   (   several   of   which   will   be   discussed   below   )   ,   it   is   probably   fair   to   say   that   there   is   no   demarcation   <br> </br>
   line   between   science   and   non-science   ,   or   between   science   and   pseudo-science   ,   which   would   win   assent   from   a   majority   of   philosophers   .   Nor   is   there   one   <br> </br>
   which   should   win   acceptance   from   philosophers   or   anyone   else   but   more   of   that   below   .   What   lessons   are   we   to   draw   from   the   recurrent   failure   of   philosophy   to   <br> </br>
   detect   the   epistemic   traits   which   mark   science   off   from   other   systems   of   belief   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   That   failure   might   conceivably   be   due   simply   to   our   impoverished   philosophical   imagination   it   is   conceivable   ,   after   all   ,   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> science </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> really   is   sui </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> generis </span>  ,   and   that   we   philosophers   have   just   not   yet   hit   on   its   characteristic   features   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Alternatively   ,   it   may   just   be   that   there   are   no   epistemic   features   which   all   and   only   the   diSCiplines   we   accept   as   scientific   share   in   common   .   My   aim   in   this   <br> </br>
   paper   is   to   make   a   brief   excursion   into   the   history   of   the   sciencenon-science   demarcation   in   order   to   see   what   light   it   might   shed   on   the   contemporary   <br> </br>
   viability   of   the   quest   for   a   demarcation   device   .   As   far   back   as   the   time   of   Parmenides   ,   Western   philosophers   thOUght   it   important   to   distinguish   <br> </br>
   knowledge   (   episteme   )   from   mere   opinion   (   doxa   )   ,   reality   from   appearance   ,   truth   from   error   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   By   the   time   of   Aristotle   ,   these   epistemic   concerns   came   to   be   focussed   on   the   question   of   the   nature   of   scientific   knowledge   .   In   his   highly   influential   <br> </br>
   Posterior   Analytics   ,   Aristotle   described   at   length   what   was   involved   in   having   scientific   knowledge   of   something   .   To   be   scientific   ,   he   said   ,   one   must   <br> </br>
   deal   with   causes   ,   one   must   use   logical   demonstrations   ,   and   one   must   identify   the   universals   which   inhere   in   the   particulars   of   sense   .   But   above   all   ,   to   <br> </br>
   have   science   one   must   have   apodictic   certainty   .   It   is   this   last   feature   which   ,   for   Aristotle   ,   most   clearly   distinguished   the   scientific   way   of   knowing   .   <br> </br>
   What   separates   the   sciences   from   other   kinds   of   beliefs   is   the   irtfallibility   of   their   foundations   and   ,   thanks   to   that   infallibility   ,   the   <br> </br>
   incorrigibility   of   their   constituent   theories   .   The   first   principles   of   nature   are   directly   intuited   from   sense   everything   else   worthy   of   the   name   of   <br> </br>
   science   follows   demonstrably   from   these   first   principles   .   What   characterizes   the   whole   enterprise   is   a   degree   of   certainty   which   distinguishes   it   most   <br> </br>
   crucially   from   mere   opinion   .   But   Aristotle   sometimes   offered   a   second   demarcation   criterion   ,   orthogonal   to   this   one   between   science   and   opinion   .   <br> </br>
   Specifically   ,   he   distinguished   between  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> know-how </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   the   sort   of   knowledge   which   the   craftsman   and   the   engineer   possess   ) </span>  and   what   we   might   call  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> know-why </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> or </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> demonstrative   understanding   (   which   the   scientist   alone   possesses   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>

   Coming   out   of   Aristotles   work   ,   then   ,   is   a   pair   of   demarcation   criteria   .   Science   is   distinguished   from   opinion   and   superstition   by   the   certainty   of   its   <br> </br>
   principles   it   is   marked   off   from   the   crafts   by   its   comprehension   of   first   causes   .   This   set   of   contrasts   comes   to   dominate   discussions   of   the   nature   of   <br> </br>
   science   throughout   the   later   Middle   Ages   and   the   Renaissance   ,   and   thus   to   proVide   a   crucial   backdrop   to   the   re-examination   of   these   issues   in   the   <br> </br>
   seventeenth   century   .   It   is   instructive   to   see   how   this   approach   worked   in   practice   .   One   of   the   most   revealing   examples   is   provided   by   pre-modern   <br> </br>
   astronomy   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   By   the   time   of   Ptolemy   ,   mathematical   astronomers   had   largely   abandoned   the   (   Aristotelian   )   tradition   of   seeking   to   derive   an   account   of   planetary   motion   <br> </br>
   from   the   causes   or   essences   of   the   planetary   material   .   As   Duhem   and   others   have   shown   in   great   detail   ,   1   many   astronomers   sought   simply   to   correlate   <br> </br>
   planetary   motions   ,   independently   of   any   causal   assumptions   about   the   essence   or   first   principles   of   the   heavens   .   Straightaway   ,   this   turned   them   from   <br> </br>
   scientists   into   craftsmen.2   To   make   matters   worse   ,   astronomers   used   a   technique   of   post   hoc   testing   of   their   theories   .   Rather   than   deriving   their   models   <br> </br>
   from   directly-intuited   first   principles   ,   they   offered   hypothetical   constructions   of   planetary   motions   and   positions   and   then   compared   the   <br> </br>
   predictions   drawn   from   their   models   with   the   observed   positions   of   the   heavenly   bodies   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   mode   of   theory   testing   is   ,   of   course   ,   highly   fallible   and   non-demonstrative   and   it   was   known   at   the   time   to   be   so   .   The   central   point   for   our   purposes   is   <br> </br>
   that   ,   by   abandoning   a   demonstrative   method   based   on   necessary   first   principles   ,   the   astronomers   were   indulging   in   mere   opinion   rather   than   knowledge   ,   <br> </br>
   putting   themselves   well   beyond   the   scientific   pale   .   Through   virtually   the   whole   of   the   Middle   and   indeed   up   until   the   beginning   of   the   seventeenth   <br> </br>
   century   ,   the   predominant   view   of   mathematical   astronomy   was   that   ,   for   the   reasons   indicated   ,   it   did   not   qualify   as   a   science   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   It   is   worth   noting   in   passing   that   much   of   the   furor   caused   by   the   astronomical   work   of   Copernicus   and   Kepler   was   a   result   of   the   fact   that   they   were   claiming   <br> </br>
   to   make   astronomy   scientific   again   .   )   More   generally   ,   the   seventeenth   century   brought   a   very   deep   shift   in   demarcationist   sensibilities   .   To   make   a   long   <br> </br>
   and   fascinating   story   unconscionably   brief   ,   we   can   say   that   most   seventeenth   century   thinkers   accepted   Aristotles   first   demarcation   criterion   (   viz   .   ,   <br> </br>
   between   infallible   science   and   fallible   opinion   )   ,   but   rejected   his   second   (   between   know-how   and   understanding   )   .   For   instance   ,   if   we   look   to   the   work   of   <br> </br>
   Galileo   ,   Huygens   or   Newton   ,   we   see   a   refusal   to   prefer   know-why   to   know-how   indeed   ,   all   three   were   prepared   to   regard   as   entirely   scientific   ,   systems   of   <br> </br>
   belief   which   laid   no   claim   to   an   understanding   grounded   in   primary   causes   or   essences   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Thus </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Galileo </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> claimed   to   know   little   or   nothing   about   the   underlying   causes   responsible   for   the   free   fall   of   bodies   ,   and   in   his   own   science   of   kinematics   he </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> steadfastly   refused   to   speculate   about   such   matters </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> But </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Galileo </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> believed   that   he   could   still   sustain   his   claim   to   be   developing   a   science   of   motion </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> because   the   results   he   reached   were   ,   so   he   claimed   ,   infallible   and   demonstrative </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Similarly   ,   Newton   in   Principia   was   not   indifferent   to   causal   explanation   ,   and   freely   admitted   that   he   would   like   to   know   the   causes   of   gravitational   <br> </br>
   phenomena   but   he   was   emphatic   that   ,   even   without   a   knowledge   of   the   causes   of   gravity   ,   one   can   engage   in   a   sophisticated   and   scientific   account   of   the   <br> </br>
   gravitational   behavior   of   the   heavenly   bodies   .   As   with   Galileo   ,   Newton   regarded   his   non-causal   account   as   scientifical   because   of   the   (   avowed   )   <br> </br>
   certainty   of   its   conclusions   .   As   Newton   told   his   readers   over   and   again   ,   he   did   not   engage   in   hypotheses   and   speculations   :   he   purported   to   be   deriving   his   <br> </br>
   theories   directly   from   the   phenomena   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Here   again   ,   the   infallibility   of   results   ,   rather   than   their   derivability   from   first   causes   ,   comes   to   be   the   single   touchstone   of   scientific   status   .   <br> </br>
   Despite   the   divergence   of   approach   among   thinkers   of   the   seventeenth   and   eighteenth   centuries   ,   there   is   widespread   agreement   that   scientific   <br> </br>
   knowledge   is   apodictically   certain   .   And   this   consensus   cuts   across   most   of   the   usual   epistemological   divides   of   the   period   .   For   instance   ,   Bacon   ,   Locke   ,   <br> </br>
   Leibniz   ,   Descartes   ,   Newton   and   Kant   are   in   accord   about   this   way   of   characterizing   science.3   They   may   disagree   about   how   precisely   to   certify   the   <br> </br>
   certainty   of   knowledge   ,   but   none   quarrels   with   the   claim   that   science   and   infallible   knowledge   are   co-terminous   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   I   have   shown   elsewhere,4   this   influential   account   fmally   and   decisively   came   unraveled   in   the   nineteenth   century   with   the   emergence   and   eventual   <br> </br>
   triumph   of   a   fallibilistic   perspective   in   epistemology   .   Once   one   accepts   ,   as   most   thinkers   had   by   the   mid-nineteenth   century   ,   that   science   offers   no   <br> </br>
   apodictic   certainty   ,   that   all   scientific   theories   are   corrigible   and   may   be   subject   to   serious   emendation   ,   then   it   is   no   longer   viable   to   attempt   to   <br> </br>
   distinguish   science   from   non-science   by   assimilating   that   distinction   to   the   difference   between   knowledge   and   opinion   .   Indeed   ,   the   unambiguous   <br> </br>
   implication   of   fallibilism   is   that   there   is   no   difference   between   knowledge   and   opinion   :   within   a   fallibilist   framework   ,   scientific   belief   turns   out   to   <br> </br>
   be   just   a   species   of   the   genus   opinion   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Several   nineteenth   century   philosophers   of   science   tried   to   take   some   of   the   sting   out   of   this   volte-face   by   suggesting   that   scientific   opinions   were   <br> </br>
   more   probable   or   more   reliable   than   non-scientific   ones   but   even   they   conceded   that   it   was   no   longer   possible   to   make   infallibility   the   hallmark   of   <br> </br>
   scientific   knowledge   .   With   certainty   no   longer   available   as   the   demarcation   tool   ,   nineteenth   century   philosophers   and   scientists   quickly   forged   <br> </br>
   other   tools   to   do   the   job   .   Thinkers   as   diverse   as   Comte   ,   Bain   ,   Jevons   ,   Helmholtz   and   Mach   (   to   name   only   a   few   )   began   to   insist   that   what   really   marks   science   <br> </br>
   off   from   everything   else   is   its   methodology   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> There   was   ,   they   maintained   ,   something   called   the   scientific   method   even   if   that   method   was   not   fool-proof </span>  (   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> the   acceptance   of </span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level2 subject2"> fallibilism </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> demanded   that   concession   )   ,   it   was   at   least   a   better   technique   for   testing   empirical   claims   than   any   other </span></span>  <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> And   if   it   did   make   mistakes   ,   it   was   sufficiently   self-corrective   that   it   would   soon   discover   them   and   put   them   right </span>  <br> </br>
   .   As   one   writer   remarked   a   few   years   later   :   if   science   lead   us   astray   ,   more   science   will   set   us   straight.5   One   need   hardly   add   that   the   nineteenth   century   did   <br> </br>
   not   invent   the   idea   of   a   logic   of   scientific   inquiry   that   dates   back   at   least   to   Aristotle   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   new   insistence   in   this   period   is   on   a   fallible   method   which   ,   for   all   its   fallibility   ,   is   nonetheless   superior   to   its   non-scientific   rivals   .   This   <br> </br>
   effort   to   mark   science   off   from   other   things   required   one   to   show   two   things   .   First   ,   that   the   various   activities   regarded   as   science   utilized   essentially   <br> </br>
   the   same   repertoire   of   methods   (   hence   the   importance   in   the   period   of   the   so-called   thesis   of   the   unity   of   method   )   secondly   ,   the   epistemic   credentials   of   <br> </br>
   this   method   had   to   be   established   .   At   first   blush   ,   this   program   of   identifying   science   with   a   certain   technique   of   inquiry   is   not   a   silly   one   indeed   ,   it   <br> </br>
   still   persists   in   some   respectable   circles   even   in   our   time   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   nineteenth   century   could   not   begin   to   deliver   on   the   two   requirements   just   mentioned   because   there   was   no   agreement   about   what   the   scientific   <br> </br>
   method   was   .   Some   took   it   to   be   the   canons   of   inductive   reasoning   sketched   out   by   Herschel   and   Mill   .   Others   insisted   that   the   basic   methodological   <br> </br>
   principle   of   science   was   that   its   theories   must   be   restricted   to   observable   116   entities   (   the   nineteenth   century   requirement   of   vera   causa).6   Still   <br> </br>
   others   ,   like   Whewell   and   Peirce   ,   rejected   the   search   for   verae   causae   altogether   and   argued   that   the   only   decisive   methodological   test   of   a   theory   <br> </br>
   involved   its   ability   successfully   to   make   surprising   predictions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Absent   agreement   on   what   the   scientific   method   amounted   to   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> demarcationists </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> were   scarcely   in   a   position   to   argue   persuasively </span>  that   what  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> individuated </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> science </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   its   method </span>  .   This   approach   was   further   embarrassed   by   a   notorious   set   of   ambiguities   surrounding   several   of   its   key   components   .   Specifically   <br> </br>
   ,   many   of   the   meth-   odological   rules   proposed   were   much   too   ambiguous   for   one   to   tell   when   they   were   being   followed   and   when   breached   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   ,   such   common   methodo-   logical   rules   as   avoid   ad   hoc   hypotheses   ,   postulate   simple   theories   ,   feign   no   hypotheses   ,   and   eschew   theoretical   entities   <br> </br>
   involved   complex   conceptions   which   neither   scientists   nor   philosophers   of   the   period   were   willing   to   explicate   .   To   exacerbate   matters   still   further   ,   <br> </br>
   what   most   philoso-   phers   of   science   of   the   period   offered   up   as   an   account   of   the   scientific   method   bore   little   resemblance   to   the   methods   actually   used   by   <br> </br>
   working   scientists   ,   a   point   made   with   devastating   clarity   by   Pierre   Duhem   in   1908   .   8   As   one   can   see   ,   the   situation   by   the   late   nineteenth   century   was   more   <br> </br>
   than   a   little   ironic   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   At   precisely   that   juncture   when   science   was   beginning   to   have   a   decisive   impact   on   the   lives   and   institutions   of   Western   man   ,   at   precisely   that   time   when   <br> </br>
   scientism   (   Le   .   ,   the   belief   that   science   and   science   alone   has   the   answers   to   all   our   answerable   questions   )   was   gaining   ground   ,   in   exactly   that   quarter   <br> </br>
   century   when   scientists   were   doing   battle   in   earnest   with   all   manner   of   pseudo-scientists   (   e.g.   ,   homeopathic   physicians   ,   spiritualists   ,   <br> </br>
   phrenologists   ,   biblical   geologists   )   ,   scientists   and   philosophers   found   them-   selves   empty-handed   .   Except   at   the   rhetorical   level   ,   there   was   no   <br> </br>
   longer   any   consensus   about   what   separated   science   from   anything   else   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Surprisingly   (   or   ,   if   one   is   cynically   inclined   ,   quite   expectedly   )   ,   the   absence   of   a   plausible   demarcation   criterion   did   not   stop   fin   de   siecle   <br> </br>
   scientists   and   philosophers   from   haranguing   against   what   they   regarded   as   pseudo-scientific   nonsense   (   any   more   than   their   present-day   counterparts   <br> </br>
   are   hampered   by   a   similar   lack   of   consensus   )   but   it   did   make   their   protestations   less   compelling   than   their   confident   denunciations   of   quackery   might   <br> </br>
   otherwise   suggest   .   It   is   true   ,   of   course   ,   that   there   was   still   much   talk   about   the   scientific   method   and   doubtless   many   hoped   that   the   methods   of   science   <br> </br>
   could   play   the   demar-   cationist   role   formerly   assigned   to   certainty   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   ,   leaving   aside   the   fact   that   agreement   was   lacking   about   precisely   what   the   scientific   method   was   ,   there   was   no   good   reason   as   yet   to   prefer   anyone   of   <br> </br>
   the   proposed   scientific   methods   to   any   purportedly   non-scientific   ones   ,   since   no   one   had   managed   to   show   either   that   any   of   the   candidate   scientific   <br> </br>
   methods   qualified   them   as   knowledge   (   in   the   traditional   sense   of   the   term   )   or   ,   even   more   minimally   ,   that   those   methods   were   epistemically   superior   to   <br> </br>
   their   rivals   .   Before   we   move   to   consider   and   to   assess   some   familiar   demarcationist   proposals   from   our   own   epoch   ,   we   need   to   engage   briefly   in   certain   <br> </br>
   metaphilosophical   preliminaries   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Specifically   ,   we   should   ask   three   central   questions   :   (   1   )   What   conditions   of   adequacy   should   a   proposed   demarcation   criterion   satisfy   ?   (   2   )   Is   the   <br> </br>
   criterion   under   consideration   offering   necessary   or   sufficient   conditions   ,   or   both   ,   for   scientific   status   ?   (   3   )   What   actions   or   judgments   are   implied   <br> </br>
   by   the   claim   that   a   certain   belief   or   activity   is   scientific   or   unscientific   ?   (   1   )   Early   in   the   history   of   thought   it   was   inevitable   that   characterizations   <br> </br>
   of   science   and   knowledge   would   be   largely   stipulative   and   a   priori   .   After   all   ,   until   as   late   as   the   seventeenth   century   ,   there   were   few   developed   examples   <br> </br>
   of   empirical   sciences   which   one   could   point   to   or   whose   properties   one   could   study   under   such   circumstances   ,   where   one   is   working   largely   ab   initio   ,   one   <br> </br>
   can   be   uncompromisingly   legislative   about   how   a   term   like   science   or   knowledge   will   be   used   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   as   the   sciences   developed   and   prospered   ,   philosophers   began   to   see   the   task   of   formulating   a   demarcation   criterion   as   no   longer   a   purely   stipulative   <br> </br>
   undertaking   .   Any   proposed   dividing   line   between   science   and   non-science   would   have   to   be   (   at   least   in   part   )   explicative   and   thus   sensitive   to   existing   <br> </br>
   patterns   of   usage   .   Accordingly   ,   if   one   were   today   to   offer   a   defmition   of   science   which   classified   (   say   )   the   major   theories   of   physics   and   chemistry   as   <br> </br>
   non-scientific   ,   one   would   thereby   have   failed   to   reconstruct   some   paradigmatic   cases   of   the   use   of   the   term   .   Where   Plato   or   Aristotle   need   not   have   <br> </br>
   worried   if   some   or   even   most   of   the   intellectual   activities   of   their   time   failed   to   satisfy   their   respective   definitions   of   science   ,   it   is   inconceivable   <br> </br>
   that   we   would   fmd   a   demarcation   criterion   satisfactory   which   relegated   to   unscientific   status   a   large   number   of   the   activities   we   consider   scientific   or   <br> </br>
   which   admitted   as   sciences   activities   which   seem   to   us   decidedly   unscientific   .
