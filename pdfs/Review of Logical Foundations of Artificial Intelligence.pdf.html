 Review   of   Logical   Foundations   of   Artificial   Intelligence   Book   Reviews   BookReviews   Automated   Reasoning   :   Thirty-Three   Basic   Research   Problems   The   <br> </br>
   discussion   of   the   obstacles   in   Chapter   2   is   relaxing   ;   although   some   repetition   exists   in   the   book   ,   the   author   spares   you   a   puffy   pseudophilosophical   <br> </br>
   treatise   on   AI   in   general   and   AR   specifically   .   After   reading   this   chapter   ,   you   are   convinced   there   is   no   general   problem   solver   ,   and   you   have   a   pleasant   <br> </br>
   introduction   to   the   belly   of   the   beast   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> non-expert </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> might   have   some   problems   in   mapping   the   eight   obstacles   described   to   the   problems   and   problem   areas </span>  <br> </br>

   However   ,   the   detailed   discussion   that   forms   the   heart   of   the   book   provides   the   reader   with   ample   reward   .   It   is   clear   that   the   author   writes   with   a   freshness   <br> </br>
   and   an   obvious   love   for   logic   .   The   book   as   a   whole   is   a   rarity   in   that   it   successfully   serves   several   audiences   at   the   same   time   .   The   layperson   gets   a   real   <br> </br>
   background   knowledge   of   one   of   the   main   disciplines   of   AI   ,   and   the   theorist   gets   a   good   occasion   to   put   the   theory   to   practice   .   Most   astonishingly   ,   both   can   <br> </br>

   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Those   who   Book   Reviews   study   declarative   knowledge   representations   are   divided   about   whether   such   notations   ought   to   be   thought   of   as   variants   of   the   <br> </br>
   predicate   calculus   and   related   systems   of   mathematical   logic   invented   by   logicians   ,   mathematicians   ,   and   philosophers   in   this   century   .   Lately   ,   those   <br> </br>
   who   think   they   ought   to   be   so   regarded   seem   to   be   winning   .   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   have   no   doubt   and   take   it   for   granted   that   the   semantic   tools   of   <br> </br>
   mathematical   logic   are   indispensable   for   analyzing   knowledge   representations   .   They   adopt   the   label   Iogicism   for   this   doctrine   .   When   they   reach   the   <br> </br>
   topic   of   inference   ,   however   ,   they   seem   to   lose   their   way   .   <br> </br>

  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Chapters </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> 3   through   5   are   concerned   with   this   topic   ,   but   it   is   central   to   the   entire   book </span>  .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   The   authors   give   several   examples   throughout   the   book   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Chapter   7 </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   for   instance   ,   is   devoted   to   In   competition   with   this   diversity   is   the   idea   of   a   unified </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> model   of   inference </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   desire   for   such   a   model   is   strong   among   those   who   study   declarative   representations   ,   and   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   are   no   exception   .   As   are   most   of   their   <br> </br>
   colleagues   ,   they   are   drawn   to   the   model   of   inference   as   the   derivation   of   conclusions   that   are   entailed   by   a   set   of   beliefs   .   They   wander   from   this   idea   in   a   <br> </br>
   few   places   but   not   for   long   .   It   is   not   hard   to   see   why   :   Deduction   is   one   of   the   fews   kinds   of   inference   for   which   we   have   an   interesting   general   theory   .   It   ’s   <br> </br>
   clear   what   the   authors   are   thinking   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   are   studying   foundations   ;   so   ,   what   ’s   important   is   what   should   be   inferred   in   a   situation   ,   not   what   actually   can   be   practically   inferred   (   compared   ,   <br> </br>
   say   ,   to   theoretical   mechanics   )   .   However   ,   as   I   argued   earlier   ,   what   should   be   inferred   is   probably   different   from   what   is   entailed   by   current   beliefs   <br> </br>
   because   not   all   that   is   entailed   is   useful   and   not   all   that   is   probably   correct   is   entailed   .   The   authors   are   forced   to   acknowledge   these   discrepancies   in   <br> </br>
   their   detours   to   alternative   inference   techniques   in   Chapters   6   ,   7   ,   and   8   ,   but   their   heart   is   n’t   in   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   it   comes   to   actual   applications   ,   they   always   revert   to   classical   deduction   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> unsophisticated </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> reader   should   be   warned   that   the   foundations   being </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> explored   are   not   exactly   the   foundations   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> AI </span>  .   The   authors   ’   viewpoint   causes   distortions   throughout   the   book   .   The   chapter   on   planning   (   Chapter   12   )   is   <br> </br>
   typical   .   The   planning   problem   is   defined   as   finding   a   constructive   proof   that   a   series   of   actions   will   bring   about   a   desired   state   of   the   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   assumed   that   the   right   way   to   find   this   proof   is   to   tailor   a   general-purpose   theorem   prover   with   a   few   specialized   strategies   .   This   description   of   the   <br> </br>
   planning   problem   is   quite   remote   from   any   description   that   active   researchers   in   the   field   would   produce   .   Perhaps   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   feel   that   <br> </br>
   techniques   for   solving   planning   problems   will   come   and   go   ,   but   the   foundations   can   be   secure   .   If   so   ,   they   are   too   casual   about   the   implicit   claim   .   I   admit   to   <br> </br>
   bias   on   these   questions   .   My   skepticism   should   be   balanced   by   the   agreement   of   many   perfectly   reasonable   people   with   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   ’s   view   .   <br> </br>
   However   ,   it   bothers   me   that   questions   about   the   scope   of   their   enterprise   are   treated   so   superficially   in   this   book   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Let   me   put   such   doubts   aside   and </span>  <br> </br>

   .   McDermott   makes   some   valid   points   in   his   review   .   I   acknowledge   some   of   these   in   this   response   .   It   ’s   too   bad   that   he   chose   to   embed   the   helpful   comments   in   <br> </br>
   the   context   of   his   bynow-tiresome   doubts   about   the   value   of   logic   in   AI   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   The   reader   who   wants   to   be   saturated   with   the   arguments   surrounding   these   doubts   should   see   McDermott   ’s   1977   A   Critique   of   Pure   Reason   and   the   <br> </br>
   accompanying   commentary   in   Computational   Intelligence   ,   3(3   )   .   McDermott   accurately   summarizes   our   book   as   being   about   the   representation   and   use   of   <br> </br>
   declarative   knowledge   in   AI   .   He   duly   notes   that   declarative   knowledge   requires   a   notation   and   that   some   AI   researchers   think   most   of   the   notational   <br> </br>
   schemes   being   used   are   variants   of   the   predicate   calculus   .   He   even   says   ,   “   Lately   those   who   think   they   ought   to   be   so   regarded   seem   to   be   winning   .   <br> </br>

   ”   Under   these   circumstances   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> it   does   seem   odd   for </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> McDermott </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> to   devote   much   space   to   complaining   about   the   logical   basis   of   a   book   whose   very   title   proclaims </span>  <br> </br>

   In   any   case   ,   given   such   a   title   ,   it   would   n’t   seem   necessary   that   readers   “   should   be   warned   that   the   foundations   being   explored   are   not   exactly   the   <br> </br>

   good   points   about   our   chapters   on   planning   .   Our   goal   in   these   chapters   was   to   present   the   fundamental   conceptualization   of   the   state-based   approach   and   <br> </br>
   the   situation   calculus   based   on   it   .   <br> </br>
