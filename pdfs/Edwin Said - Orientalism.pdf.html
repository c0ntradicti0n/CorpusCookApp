   Introduction   I   On   a   visit   to   Beirut   during   the   terrible   civil   war   of   1975   -   1976   a   French   journalist   wrote   regretfully   of   the   gutted   downtown   area   that   “   it   <br> </br>
   had   once   seemed   to   belong   to   .   .   .   the   Orient   of   Chateaubriand   and   Nerval.”1   He   was   right   about   the   place   ,   of   course   ,   especially   so   far   as   a   European   was   <br> </br>
   concerned   .   The   Orient   was   almost   a   European   invention   ,   and   had   been   since   antiquity   ‘   a   place   of   romance   ,   exotic   beings   ,   haunting   memories   and   landscapes   <br> </br>
   ,   remarkable   experiences   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Now   it   was   disappearing   in   a   sense   it   had   happened   ,   its   time   was   over   .   Perhaps   it   seemed   irrelevant   that   Orientals   themselves   had   something   at   stake   in   the   <br> </br>
   process   ,   that   even   in   the   time   of   Chateaubriand   and   Nerval   Orientals   had   lived   there   ,   and   that   now   it   was   they   who   were   suffering   the   main   thing   for   the   <br> </br>
   European   visitor   was   a   European   representation   of   the   Orient   and   its   contemporary   fate   ,   both   of   which   had   a   privileged   communal   significance   for   the   <br> </br>
   journalist   and   his   French   readers   .   Americans   will   not   feel   quite   the   same   about   the   Orient   ,   which   for   them   is   much   more   likely   to   be   associated   very   <br> </br>
   differently   with   the   Far   East   (   China   and   Japan   ,   mainly   )   .   <br> </br>

   Orient   is   not   only   adjacent   to   Europe   it   is   also   the   place   of   Europe   ’s   greatest   and   richest   and   oldest   colonies   ,   the   source   of   its   civilizations   and   <br> </br>

   area   studies   ,   it   is   true   that   the   term   Orientalism   is   less   preferred   by   specialists   today   ,   both   because   it   is   too   vague   and   general   and   because   it   connotes   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Nevertheless   books   are   written   and   congresses   held   with   “   the   Orient   ”   as   their   main   focus   ,   with   the   Orientalist   in   his   new   or   old   guise   as   their   main </span>  <br> </br>

   Related   to   this   academic   tradition   ,   whose   fortunes   ,   transmigrations   ,   specializations   ,   and   transmissions   are   in   part   the   subject   of   this   study   ,   is   a   <br> </br>
   more   general   meaning   for   Orientalism   .   Orientalism   is   a   style   of   thought   based   upon   an   ontological   and   epistemological   distinction   made   between   “   the   <br> </br>
   Orient   ”   and   (   most   of   the   time   )   “   the   Occident   .   ”   Thus   a   very   large   mass   of   writers   ,   among   whom   are   poets   ,   novelists   ,   philosophers   ,   political   theorists   ,   <br> </br>
   economists   ,   and   imperial   administrators   ,   have   accepted   the   basic   distinction   between   East   and   West   as   the   starting   point   for   elaborate   theories   ,   epics   <br> </br>
   ,   novels   ,   epics   ,   social   descriptions   and   political   accounts   concerning   the   11   Orient   ,   its   people   ,   customs   ,   “   mind   ,   ”   destiny   ,   and   so   on   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> This </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Orientalism   can   accommodate   Aeschylus   ,   say   ,   and   Victor   Hugo   ,   Dante   and   Karl   Marx </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   A   little   later   in   this   introduction   I   shall   deal   with   the   methodological   problems   one   encounters   in   so   broadly   construed   a   “   field   ”   as   this   .   The   inter   <br> </br>
   change   between   the   academic   and   the   more   or   less   imaginative   meaning   of   Orientalism   is   a   constant   one   ,   and   since   the   late   eighteenth   century   there   has   been   <br> </br>
   a   considerable   ,   quite   disciplined-perhaps   even   regulated-traffic   between   the   two   .   Here   I   come   to   the   third   meaning   of   Orientalism   ,   which   is   something   <br> </br>
   more   historically   and   materially   defined   than   either   of   the   other   two   .   Taking   the   late   eighteenth   century   as   a   very   roughly   defined   starting   point   <br> </br>
   Orientalism   can   be   discussed   and   analyzed   as   the   corporate   institution   for   dealing   with   the   Orientdealing   with   it   by   making   statements   about   it   ,   <br> </br>
   authorizing   views   of   it   ,   describing   it   ,   by   teaching   it   settling   it   ,   ruling   over   it   :   in   short   ,   Orientalism   as   a   Western   style   for   dominating   restructuring   <br> </br>
   ,   and   having   authority   over   the   Orient   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   found   it   useful   here   to   employ   is   a   Foucault   ’s   notion   of   a   discourse   ,   as   described   by   him   in   The   Archaeology   of   Knowledge   and   in   Discipline   and   Punish   ,   <br> </br>
   to   identify   Orientalism   .   My   contention   is   that   without   examining   Orientalism   as   a   discourse   one   can   not   possibly   understand   the   enormously   systematic   <br> </br>
   discipline   by   which   European   culture   was   able   to   manage-and   even   produce-the   Orient   politically   ,   sociologically   ,   militarily   ,   ideologically   ,   <br> </br>
   scientifically   ,   and   imaginatively   during   the   post-Enlightenment   period   .   Moreover   ,   so   authoritative   a   position   did   Orientalism   have   that   I   believe   no   <br> </br>
   one   writing   ,   thinking   ,   or   acting   on   the   Orient   could   do   so   without   taking   account   of   the   limitations   on   thought   and   action   imposed   by   Orientalism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> In   brief   ,   because   of   Orientalism   the   Orient   was   not   (   and   is   not   )   a   free   subject   of   thought   or   action </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> This   is   not   to   say   that </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> It   also   tries   to   show   that   European   culture   gained   in   strength   and   identity   by   setting   itself   off   against   the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Orient </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as   a   sort   of   surrogate   an   even </span>  <br> </br>

   ,   Historically   and   culturally   there   is   a   quantitative   as   well   as   a   qualitative   difference   between   the   Franco-British   involvement   in   the   Orient   <br> </br>
   and-until   the   period   of   American   ascendancy   after   12   World   War   II-the   involvement   of   every   other   European   and   Atlantic   power   .   To   speak   of   Orientalism   <br> </br>
   therefore   is   to   speak   mainly   ,   although   not   exclusively   ,   of   a   British   and   French   cultural   enterprise   a   project   whose   dimensions   take   in   such   disparate   <br> </br>

   domesticated   for   local   European   use-the   list   can   be   extended   more   or   less   indefinitely   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   point   is   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Orientalism </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> derives   from   a   particular   closeness   experienced   between   Britain   and   France </span>  and  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   Orient   ,   which   until   the   early   nineteenth </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> century   had   really   meant   only   India   and   the   Bible   lands </span>  .   From   the   beginning   of   the   nineteenth   century   until   the   end   of   World   War   II   France   and   Britain   <br> </br>
   dominated   the   Orient   and   Orientalism   since   World   War   II   America   has   dominated   the   Orient   ,   and   approaches   it   as   France   and   Britain   once   did   .   Out   of   that   <br> </br>
   closeness   whose   dynamic   is   enormously   productive   even   if   it   always   demonstrates   the   comparatively   greater   strength   of   the   Occident   (   British   ,   French   ,   <br> </br>
   or   American   )   ,   comes   the   large   body   of   texts   I   call   Orientalist   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   should   be   said   at   once   that   even   with   the   generous   number   of   books   and   authors   that   I   examine   ,   there   is   a   much   larger   number   that   I   simply   have   had   to   leave   <br> </br>
   out   .   My   argument   ,   however   ,   depends   neither   upon   an   exhaustive   catalogue   of   texts   dealing   with   the   Orient   nor   upon   a   clearly   delimited   set   of   texts   ,   <br> </br>
   authors   ,   and   ideas   that   together   make   up   the   Orientalist   canon   .   I   have   depended   instead   upon   a   different   methodological   alternative-whose   backbone   in   a   <br> </br>
   sense   is   the   set   of   historical   generalizations   I   have   so   far   been   making   in   this   Introduction-and   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   it   is   these   I   want   now   to   discuss   in   more   analytical   detail   .

   .   Therefore   as   much   as   the   West   itself   ,   the   Orient   is   an   idea   that   has   a   history   and   a   tradition   of   thought   ,   imagery   ,   and   vocabulary   that   have   given   it   reality   <br> </br>

   Having   said   that   ,   one   must   go   on   to   state   a   number   of   reasonable   qualifications   .   In   the   first   place   ,   it   would   be   wrong   to   conclude   that   the   Orient   was   <br> </br>
   essentially   an   idea   ,   or   a   creation   with   no   corresponding   reality   .   When   Disraeli   said   in   his   novel   Tancred   that   the   East   was   a   career   ,   he   meant   that   to   be   <br> </br>
   interested   in   the   East   was   something   bright   young   Westerners   would   find   to   be   an   all   consuming   passion   he   should   not   be   interpreted   as   saying   that   the   East   <br> </br>
   was   only   a   career   for   Westerners   .   There   were-and   are-   cultures   and   nations   whose   location   is   in   the   East   ,   and   their   lives   ,   histories   ,   and   customs   have   a   <br> </br>
   brute   reality   obviously   greater   than   anything   that   could   be   said   about   them   in   the   West   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   About   that   fact   this   study   of   Orientalism   has   very   little   to   contribute   ,   except   to   acknowledge   it   tacitly   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> But   the   phenomenon   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Orientalism </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as   I   study   it </span>  <br> </br>

   It   fairly   stands   for   the   pattern   of   relative   strength   between   East   and   West   ,   and   the   discourse   about   the   Orient   that   it   enabled   .   This   brings   us   to   a   third   <br> </br>
   qualification   .   One   ought   never   to   assume   that   the   structure   of   Orientalism   is   nothing   more   an   a   structure   of   lies   or   of   myths   which   were   the   truth   about   them   <br> </br>
   to   be   told   ,   would   simply   blow   away   .   I   myself   believe   that   Orientalism   is   more   particularly   valuable   as   a   sign   of   European-Atlantic   power   over   the   Orient   <br> </br>
   then   it   is   as   a   veridic   discourse   about   the   Orient   (   which   is   what   ,   in   its   academic   or   scholarly   form   ,   it   claims   to   be   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Never   theless   ,   what   we   must   respect   and   try   to   grasp   is   the   sheer   knitted   together   strength   of   Orientalist   discourse   ,   its   very   close   ties   to   the   enabling   <br> </br>
   socio-economic   and   political   institutions   ,   and   its   redoubt-   able   durability   .   After   all   ,   any   system   of   ideas   that   can   remain   unchanged   as   teachable   <br> </br>
   wisdom   (   in   academies   ,   books   ,   congresses   ,   universities   ,   foreign-service   institutes   )   from   the   period   of   Ernest   Renan   in   the   late   1840s   until   the   present   <br> </br>
   in   the   United   States   must   be   something   more   formidable   than   a   mere   collection   of   .   lies   .   Orientalism   ,   therefore   ,   is   not   an   airy   European   fantasy   about   the   <br> </br>
   Orient   but   a   created   body   of   theory   and   practice   in   which   ,   for   many   rations   ,   there   has   been   a   considerable   material   investment   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Continued   investment   made   Orientalism   ,   as   a   system   of   knowledge   about   the   Orient   ,   an   accepted   grid   for   filtering   through   the   Orient   into </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Western </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> institutions   ,   and   of   other   persons   works   not   through   domination   but   by   what   Gramsci   calls   consent </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   any   society   not   totalitarian   ,   then   ,   certain   cultural   forms   predominate   over   others   ,   just   as   certain   ideas   are   more   in-   fluential   than   others   the   form   <br> </br>
   of   this   cultural   leadership   is   what   Gramsci   has   identified   as   hegemony   ,   an   indispensable   concept   for   any   understanding   of   cultural   life   in   the   <br> </br>
   industrial   West   .   It   is   hegemony   ,   or   rather   the   result   of   cultural   hegemony   at   work   ,   that   gives   Orientalism   the   durability   and   the   strength   I   have   been   <br> </br>
   speaking   about   so   far   .   Orientalism   is   never   far   from   what   Denys   Hay   has   called   the   idea   of   Europe,3   a   collective   notion   identifying   “   us   ”   Europeans   as   <br> </br>
   against   all   “   those   ”   non-Europeans   ,   and   indeed   it   can   be   argued   that   the   major   component   in   European   culture   is   precisely   what   made   that   culture   hegemonic   <br> </br>
   both   in   and   outside   Europe   :   the   idea   of   European   identiy   as   a   superior   one   in   comparison   with   all   the   non-European   peoples   and   cultures   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   is   in   addition   the   hegemony   of   European   ideas   about   the   Orient   ,   themselves   reiterating   European   superiority   over   Orental   backwardness   usually   <br> </br>
   overriding   the   possibility   that   a   more   independent   ,   or   more   skeptical   ,   thinker   might   have   had   different   views   on   the   matter   .   In   a   quite   constant   way   ,   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Orientalism </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> depends   for   its   strategy   on   this   flexible   positional   superiority   ,   which   puts   the   Westerner   in   a   whole   series   of   possible   relationships   with </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   Orient   without   ever   losing   him   the   relative   upper   hand </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   And   why   should   it   have   been   otherwise   ,   especially   during   the   period   of   extraordinary   European   ascendancy   from   the   late   Renaissance   to   the   present   ?
