 Said-Introduction   and   Chapter   1   of   Orientalism   London   and   Henley   First   published   in   1978   Broadway   House   ,   Newton   Road   ,   Henley-on-Thames   ,   Reprinted   and   <br> </br>

   Acknowledgements   I   have   been   reading   about   Orientalism   for   a   number   of   years   ,   but   most   of   this   book   was   written   during   1975   -   1976   ,   which   I   spent   as   a   Fellow   <br> </br>
   at   the   Center   for   Advanced   Study   in   the   Behavioural   Sciences   ,   Stanfort   ,   California   .   In   this   unique   and   generous   institution   ,   it   was   my   good   fortune   not   <br> </br>
   only   to   have   benefited   agreeably   froms   several   colleagues   ,   but   also   from   the   help   of   Joan   Warmbrunn   ,   Chris   Hoth   ,   Jane   Kielsmeier   ,   Preston   Cutler   ,   and   the   <br> </br>
   center   ’s   director   ,   Gardner   Lindzey   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   list   of   friends   ,   colleagues   ,   and   students   who   read   ,   or   listened   to   ,   parts   or   the   whole   of   this   manuscript   is   so   long   as   to   embarrass   me   ,   and   now   that   it   has   <br> </br>
   finally   appeared   as   a   book   ,   perhaps   even   them   ,   Nevertheless   I   should   mention   with   gratitude   the   always   helpful   encouragement   of   Janet   and   Ibrahim   <br> </br>
   Abu-Lughod   ,   Noam   Chomsky   ,   and   Roger   Owen   ,   who   followed   this   project   from   its   beginning   to   its   conclusion   .   Likewise   I   must   gratefully   acknowledge   the   <br> </br>
   helpful   and   critical   interest   of   the   colleagues   ,   friends   ,   and   students   in   various   places   whose   questions   and   discussion   sharpened   the   text   <br> </br>
   considerably   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Andre   Schiffrin   and   Jeanne   Morton   of   Pantheon   Books   were   ideal   publisher   and   copy   editor   ,   respectively   ,   and   made   the   ordeal   (   for   the   author   ,   at   least   )   of   <br> </br>
   preparing   the   manuscript   an   instructive   and   genuinely   intelligent   process   .   Marian   Said   helped   me   a   great   deal   with   her   research   on   the   early   modern   <br> </br>
   history   of   Orientalist   institutions   .   Apart   from   that   ,   though   ,   her   loving   support   really   made   much   of   the   work   on   this   book   not   only   enjoyable   but   possible   <br> </br>
   .   On   a   visit   to   Beirut   during   the   terrible   civil   war   of   1975   -   1976   a   French   journalist   wrote   regretfully   of   the   gutted   downtown   area   that   “   it   had   once   seemed   <br> </br>
   to   belong   to   .   .   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   the   Orient   of   Chateaubriand   and   Nerval.”1   He   was   right   about   the   place   ,   of   course   ,   especially   so   far   as   a   European   was   concerned   .   The   Orient   was   almost   a   <br> </br>
   European   invention   ,   and   had   been   since   antiquity   ‘   a   place   of   romance   ,   exotic   beings   ,   haunting   memories   and   landscapes   ,   remarkable   experiences   .   Now   it   <br> </br>
   was   disappearing   ;   in   a   sense   it   had   happened   ,   its   time   was   over   .   Perhaps   it   seemed   irrelevant   that   Orientals   themselves   had   something   at   stake   in   the   <br> </br>
   process   ,   that   even   in   the   time   of   Chateaubriand   and   Nerval   Orientals   had   lived   there   ,   and   that   now   it   was   they   who   were   suffering   ;   the   main   thing   for   the   <br> </br>
   European   visitor   was   a   European   representation   of   the   Orient   and   its   contemporary   fate   ,   both   of   which   had   a   privileged   communal   significance   for   the   <br> </br>
   journalist   and   his   French   readers   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Americans   will   not   feel   quite   the   same   about   the   Orient   ,   which   for   them   is   much   more   likely   to   be   associated   very   differently   with   the   Far   East   (   China   and   <br> </br>
   Japan   ,   mainly   )   .   Unlike   the   Americans   ,   the   French   and   the   British-less   so   the   Germans   ,   Russians   ,   Spanish   ,   Portuguese   ,   Italians   ,   and   Swiss-have   had   a   <br> </br>
   long   tradition   of   what   I   shall   be   calling   Orientation   a   way   of   coming   to   terms   with   the   Orient   that   is   based   on   the   Orient   ’s   special   place   in   European   Western   <br> </br>
   experience   .   The   Orient   is   not   only   adjacent   to   Europe   ;   it   is   also   the   place   of   Europe   ’s   greatest   and   richest   and   oldest   colonies   ,   the   source   of   its   <br> </br>
   civilizations   and   languages   ,   its   cultural   contestant   ,   and   one   of   its   deepest   and   most   recurring   images   of   the   other   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   My   point   is   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Orientalism </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> derives   from   a   particular   closeness   experienced   between   Britain   and   France   and   the   Orient   ,   which   until   the   early   nineteenth </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> century   had   really   meant   only   India   and   the   Bible   lands </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   From   the   beginning   of   the   nineteenth   century   until   the   end   of   World   War   II   France   and   Britain   dominated   the   Orient   and   Orientalism   ;   since   World   War   II   <br> </br>
   America   has   dominated   the   Orient   ,   and   approaches   it   as   France   and   Britain   once   did   .   Out   of   that   closeness   whose   dynamic   is   enormously   productive   even   if   it   <br> </br>
   always   demonstrates   the   comparatively   greater   strength   of   the   Occident   (   British   ,   French   ,   or   American   )   ,   comes   the   large   body   of   texts   I   call   Orientalist   <br> </br>
   .   It   should   be   said   at   once   that   even   with   the   generous   number   of   books   and   authors   that   I   examine   ,   there   is   a   much   larger   number   that   I   simply   have   had   to   leave   <br> </br>
   out   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   argument   ,   however   ,   depends   neither   upon   an   exhaustive   catalogue   of   texts   dealing   with   the   Orient   nor   upon   a   clearly   delimited   set   of   texts   ,   authors   ,   <br> </br>
   and   ideas   that   together   make   up   the   Orientalist   canon   .   I   have   depended   instead   upon   a   different   methodological   alternative-whose   backbone   in   a   sense   is   <br> </br>
   the   set   of   historical   generalizations   I   have   so   far   been   making   in   this   Introduction-and   it   is   these   I   want   now   to   discuss   in   more   analytical   detail   .   that   <br> </br>
   men   make   their   own   history   ,   that   what   they   can   know   is   what   they   have   made   ,   and   extend   it   to   geography   :   as   both   geographical   and   cultural   entities-to   say   <br> </br>
   nothing   of   historical   entities   -such   locales   ,   regions   geographical   sectors   as   “   Orient   ”   and   “   Occident   ”   are   man-made   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Therefore   as   much   as   the   West   itself   ,   the   Orient   is   an   idea   that   has   a   history   and   a   tradition   of   thought   ,   imagery   ,   and   vocabulary   that   have   given   it   reality   <br> </br>
   and   presence   in   and   for   the   West   .   The   two   geographical   entities   thus   support   and   to   an   extent   reflect   each   other   .   Having   said   that   ,   one   must   go   on   to   state   a   <br> </br>
   number   of   reasonable   qualifications   .   In   the   first   place   ,   it   would   be   wrong   to   conclude   that   the   Orient   was   essentially   an   idea   ,   or   a   creation   with   no   <br> </br>
   corresponding   reality   .   When   Disraeli   said   in   his   novel   Tancred   that   the   East   was   a   career   ,   he   meant   that   to   be   interested   in   the   East   was   something   bright   <br> </br>
   young   Westerners   would   find   to   be   an   all   consuming   passion   ;   he   should   not   be   interpreted   as   saying   that   the   East   was   only   a   career   for   Westerners   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   were-and   are-   cultures   and   nations   whose   location   is   in   the   East   ,   and   their   lives   ,   histories   ,   and   customs   have   a   brute   reality   obviously   greater   <br> </br>
   than   anything   that   could   be   said   about   them   in   the   West   .   About   that   fact   this   study   of   Orientalism   has   very   little   to   contribute   ,   except   to   acknowledge   it   <br> </br>
   tacitly   .   But   the   phenomenon   of   Orientalism   as   I   study   it   here   deals   principally   ,   not   with   a   correspondence   between   Orientalism   and   Orient   ,   but   with   the   <br> </br>
   internal   consistency   of   Orientalism   and   its   ideas   about   the   Orient   (   the   East   as   career   )   despite   or   beyond   any   correspondence   ,   or   lack   thereof   ,   with   a   “   <br> </br>
   real   ”   Orient   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   point   is   that   Disraeli   ’s   statement   about   the   East   refers   mainly   to   that   created   consistency   ,   that   regular   constellation   of   ideas   as   the   pre-eminent   <br> </br>
   thing   about   the   Orient   ,   and   not   to   its   mere   being   ,   as   Wallace   Stevens   ’s   phrase   has   it   .   A   second   qualification   is   that   ideas   ,   cultures   ,   and   histories   can   not   <br> </br>
   seriously   be   understood   or   studied   without   their   force   ,   or   more   precisely   their   configurations   of   power   ,   also   being   studied   .   To   believe   that   the   Orient   <br> </br>
   was   created-or   ,   as   I   call   it   ,   “   Orientalized   ”   -and   to   believe   that   such   things   happen   simply   as   a   necessity   of   the   imagination   ,   is   to   be   disingenuous   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   relationship   between   Occident   and   Orient   is   a   relationship   of   power   ,   of   domination   ,   of   varying   degrees   of   a   compex   hegemony   an   is   quite   accurately   <br> </br>
   indicated   in   the   title   of   K.   M.   Panikkar   ’s   classic   Asia   and   Western   Dominance   .   ’   The   Orient   was   Orientalized   not   only   because   it   was   discovered   to   be   “   <br> </br>
   Oriental   ”   in   all   those   ways   considered   common-   place   by   an   average   nineteenth-century   European   ,   but   also   because   it   could   be-that   is   ,   submitted   to   <br> </br>
   being-made   Oriental   .   There   is   very   little   consent   to   be   found   ,   for   example   ,   in   the   fact   that   Flau-   bert   ’s   encounter   with   an   Egyptian   courtesan   produced   a   <br> </br>
   widely   in   fluential   model   of   the   Oriental   woman   ;   she   never   spoke   of   herself   ,   she   never   represented   her   emotions   ,   presence   ,   or   history   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> He   spoke   for   and   represented   her   .   He   was   foreign   ,   comparatively   wealthy   ,   male   ,   and   these   were   historical   facts   of   domination   that   allowed   him   not   only   to </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> possess   Kuchuk   Hanem   physically   but   to   speak   for   her   and   tell   his   readers   in   what   way   she   was   “   typically   Oriental </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ”   My   argument   is   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Flaubert </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ’s   situation   of   strength   in   relation   to </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kuchuk   Hanem </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   not   an   isolated   instance   .   It   fairly   stands   for   the   pattern   of </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> relative   strength   between   East   and   West   ,   and   the   discourse   about   the   Orient   that   it   enabled   .   national   or   religious   character   .   Additionally   ,   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> imaginative   examination   of   things   Oriental   was   based   more   or   less   exclusively   upon   a   sovereign   Western   consciousness   out   of   whose   unchallenged </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> centrality   an   Oriental   world   emerged   ,   first   according   to   general   ideas   about   who   or   what   was   an   Oriental   ,   then   according   to   a   detailed   logic   governed   not </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> simply   by   empirical   reality   but   by   a   battery   of   desires   ,   regressions   ,   investments   ,   and   projections </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   we   can   point   to   great   Orientalist   works   of   genuine   scholarship   like   Silvestre   de   Sacy   ’s   Chrestomathie   arabe   or   Edward   William   Lane   ’s   Account   of   the   <br> </br>
   Manners   and   Customs   of   the   Modern   Egyptians   ,   we   need   also   to   note   that   Renan   ’s   and   Gobineau   ’s   racial   ideas   came   out   of   the   same   impulse   ,   as   did   a   great   many   <br> </br>
   Victorian   pornographic   novels   (   see   the   analysis   by   Steven   Marcus   of   “   The   Lustful   Turk”4   `   )   .   My   two   fears   are   distortion   and   inaccuracy   ,   or   rather   the   kind   <br> </br>
   of   inaccuracy   produced   by   too   dogmatic   a   generality   and   too   positivistic   a   localized   focus   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   trying   to   deal   with   these   problems   I   have   tried   to   deal   with   three   main   aspects   of   my   own   contemporary   reality   that   seem   to   me   to   point   the   way   out   of   the   <br> </br>
   methodological   or   perspectival   difficulties   I   have   been   discussing   ,   difficulties   that   might   force   one   ,   in   the   first   instance   ,   into   writing   a   coarse   <br> </br>
   polemic   on   so   unacceptably   general   a   level   of   description   as   not   to   be   worth   the   effort   ,   or   in   the   second   instance   ,   into   writing   so   detailed   and   atomistic   a   <br> </br>
   series   of   analyses   as   to   lose   all   track   of   the   general   lines   of   force   informing   the   field   ,   giving   it   its   special   cogency   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   How   then   to   recognize   individuality   and   to   reconcile   it   with   its   intelligent   ,   and   by   no   means   passive   or   merely   dictatorial   ,   general   and   hegemonic   <br> </br>
   context   ?   I   mentioned   three   aspects   of   my   contemporary   reality   :   I   must   explain   and   briefly   discuss   them   now   ,   so   that   it   can   be   seen   how   I   was   led   to   a   <br> </br>
   particular   course   of   research   and   writing   .   produced   in   the   contemporary   West   (   and   here   I   speak   mainly   about   the   United   States   )   is   that   it   be   nonpolitical   ,   <br> </br>
   that   is   ,   scholarly   ,   academic   ,   impartial   ,   above   partisan   or   small-minded   doctrinal   belief   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   can   have   no   quarrel   with   such   an   ambition   in   theory   ,   perhaps   ,   but   in   practice   the   reality   is   much   more   problematic   .   No   one   has   ever   devised   a   method   for   <br> </br>
   detaching   the   scholar   from   the   circumstances   of   life   ,   from   the   fact   of   his   involvement   (   conscious   or   unconscious   )   with   a   class   ,   a   set   of   beliefs   ,   a   social   <br> </br>
   position   ,   or   from   the   mere   activity   of   being   a   member   of   a   society   .   These   continue   to   bear   on   what   he   does   professionally   ,   even   though   naturally   enough   his   <br> </br>
   research   and   its   fruits   do   attempt   to   reach   a   level   of   relative   freedom   from   the   inhibitions   and   the   restrictions   of   brute   ,   everyday   reality   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   there   is   such   a   thing   as   knowledge   that   is   less   ,   rather   than   more   ,   partial   than   the   individual   (   with   his   entangling   and   distracting   life   circumstances   <br> </br>
   )   who   produces   it   .   Yet   this   knowledge   is   not   therefore   automatically   nonpolitical   .   Put   in   this   way   ,   these   political   actualities   are   still   too   undefined   <br> </br>
   ltd   general   to   be   really   interesting   .   Anyone   would   agree   to   them   without   necessarily   agreeing   also   that   they   mattered   very   much   ,   for   instance   ,   to   <br> </br>
   Flaubert   as   he   wrote   Salammb   ,   or   to   H.   A.   R.   Gibb   as   he   wrote   Modern   Trends   in   Islam   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   trouble   is   that   there   is   too   great   a   distance   between   the   big   dominating   fact   ,   as   I   have   described   it   ,   and   the   details   of   everyday   life   that   govern   the   <br> </br>
   minute   discipline   of   a   novel   or   a   scholarly   text   as   each   is   being   written   .   Yet   if   we   eliminate   from   the   start   any   notion   that   “   big   ”   facts   like   imperial   <br> </br>
   domination   can   be   applied   mechanically   and   deterministically   to   such   complex   matters   as   culture   and   ideas   ,   then   we   will   begin   to   approach   an   interesting   <br> </br>
   kind   of   study   .   My   idea   is   that   European   and   then   American   interest   in   the   Orient   was   political   according   to   some   of   the   obvious   historical   accounts   of   it   <br> </br>
   that   I   have   given   here   ,   but   that   it   was   the   culture   that   created   that   interest   ,   that   acted   dynamically   along   with   brute   political   ,   economic   ,   and   military   <br> </br>
   rationales   to   make   the   Orient   the   varied   and   complicated   place   that   it   obviously   was   in   the   field   I   call   Orientalism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Therefore   I   study   Orientalism   as   a   dynamic   exchange   between   I   learned   and   tried   to   present   was   that   there   is   no   such   thing   as   a   merely   given   ,   or   simply   <br> </br>
   available   ,   starting   point   :   beginnings   have   to   be   made   for   each   project   in   such   a   way   as   to   enable   what   follows   from   them   .   Nowhere   in   my   experience   has   the   <br> </br>
   difficulty   of   this   lesson   been   more   consciously   lived   (   with   what   success-or   failure   -I   can   not   really   say   )   than   in   this   study   of   Orientalism   .   The   idea   of   <br> </br>
   beginning   ,   indeed   the   act   of   beginning   ,   necessarily   involves   an   act   of   delimitation   by   which   something   is   cut   out   of   a   great   mass   of   material   ,   separated   <br> </br>
   from   the   mass   ,   and   made   to   stand   for   ,   as   well   as   be   ,   a   starting   point   ,   a   beginning   ;   for   the   student   of   texts   one   such   notion   of   inaugural   delimitation   is   Louis   <br> </br>
   Althusser   ’s   idea   of   the   problematic   ,   a   specific   determinate   unity   of   a   text   ,   or   group   of   texts   ,   which   is   something   given   rise   to   by   analysis.12   Yet   in   the   <br> </br>
   case   of   Orientalism   (   as   opposed   to   the   case   of   Marx   ’s   texts   ,   which   is   what   Althusser   studies   )   there   is   not   simply   the   problem   of   finding   a   point   of   departure   <br> </br>
   ,   or   problematic   ,   but   also   the   question   of   designating   which   texts   ,   authors   ,   and   periods   are   the   ones   best   suited   for   study   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   has   seemed   to   me   foolish   to   attempt   an   encyclopedic   narrative   history   of   Orientalism   ,   first   of   all   because   if   my   guiding   principle   was   to   be   “   the   ’   <br> </br>
   European   idea   of   the   Orient   ”   there   would   be   virtually   no   limit   to   the   material   I   would   have   had   to   deal   with   ;   second   ,   because   the   narrative   model   itself   did   <br> </br>
   not   suit   my   descriptive   and   political   interests   ;   third   ,   because   in   such   books   as   Raymond   Schwab   ’s   La   Renaissance   orientale   ,   Johann   Fck   ’s   Die   Arabischen   <br> </br>
   Studien   in   Europa   bis   in   den   Anfang   des   20   .   Jahrhunderts   ,   and   more   recently   ,   Dorothee   Metlitzki   ’s   The   Matter   of   Araby   in   Medieval   England13   there   already   <br> </br>
   exist   encyclopedic   works   on   certain   aspects   of   the   European-Oriental   encounter   such   as   make   the   critic   ’s   job   ,   in   the   general   political   and   intellectual   <br> </br>
   context   .I   sketched   above   ,   a   different   one   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   the   Anglo-French-American   experience   of   the   Arabs   and   Islam   ,   which   for   almost   a   thousand   years   together   stood   for   the   Orient   .   Immediately   upon   doing   <br> </br>
   that   ,   a   large   part   of   the   Orient   seemed   to   have   been   eliminated-India   ,   Japan   ,   China   ,   and   other   sections   of   the   Far   East-not   because   these   regions   were   not   <br> </br>
   important   (   they   obviously   have   been   )   but   because   one   could   discuss   Europe   ’s   experience   of   the   Near   Orient   ,   or   of   Islam   ,   apart   from   its   experience   of   the   <br> </br>
   Far   Orient   .   Yet   at   certain   moments   of   that   general   European   history   of   interest   in   the   East   ,   particular   parts   of   the   Orient   like   Egypt   ,   Syria   ,   and   Arabia   <br> </br>
   can   not   be   discussed   without   also   studying   Europe   ’s   involvement   in   the   more   distant   parts   ,   of   which   Persia   and   India   are   the   most   important   ;   a   notable   case   <br> </br>
   in   point   is   the   connection   between   Egypt   and   India   so   far   as   eighteenth-   and   nineteenthcentury   Britain   was   concerned   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Similarly   the   French   role   in   deciphering   the   Zend-Avesta   ,   the   preeminence   of   Paris   as   a   center   of   Sanskrit   studies   during   the   first   decade   of   the   <br> </br>
   nineteenth   century   ,   the   fact   that   Napoleon   ’s   interest   in   the   went   was   contingent   upon   his   sense   of   the   British   role   in   India   :   these   Far   Eastern   interests   <br> </br>
   directly   influenced   French   interest   it   the   Near   East   ,   Islam   ,   and   the   Arabs   .   then   elaborated   upon   by   Germans   .   Silvestre   de   Sacy   ,   for   example   ,   was   not   only   <br> </br>
   the   first   modern   and   institutional   European   Orientalist   ,   who   worked   on   Islam   ,   Arabic   literature   ,   the   Druze   religion   ,   and   Sassanid   Persia   ;   he   was   also   <br> </br>
   the   teacher   of   Champollion   and   of   Franz   Bopp   ,   the   founder   of   German   comparative   linguistics   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   A   similar   claim   of   priority   and   subsequent   preeminence   can   be   made   for   William   Jones   and   Edward   William   Lane   .   Nevertheless   there   is   a   possibly   misleading   <br> </br>
   aspect   to   my   study   ,   where   ,   aside   from   an   occasional   reference   ,   I   do   not   exhaustively   discuss   the   German   developments   after   the   inaugural   period   <br> </br>
   dominated   by   Sacy   .   Any   work   that   seeks   to   provide   an   understanding   of   academic   Orientalism   and   pays   little   attention   to   scholars   like   Steinthal   ,   Mdller   ,   <br> </br>
   Becker   ,   Goldziher   ,   Brockelmann   ,   Noldeke-to   mention   only   a   handful-needs   to   be   reproached   ,   and   I   freely   reproach   myself   .   I   particularly   regret   not   <br> </br>
   taking   more   account   of   the   great   scientific   prestige   that   accrued   to   German   scholarship   by   the   middle   of   the   nineteenth   century   ,   whose   neglect   was   made   <br> </br>
   into   a   denunciation   of   insular   British   scholars   by   George   Eliot   .   <br> </br>

   .   Moreover   ,   the   German   Orient   was   almost   exclusively   a   scholarly   ,   or   at   least   a   classical   ,   Orient   :   it   was   made   the   subject   of   lyrics   ,   fantasies   ,   and   even   <br> </br>
   novels   ,   but   it   was   never   actual   ,   the   way   Egypt   and   Syria   were   actual   for   Chateaubriand   ,   Lane   ,   Lamartine   ,   Burton   ,   Disraeli   ,   or   Nerval   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   There   is   some   significance   in   the   fact   that   the   two   most   renowned   German   works   on   the   Orient   ,   Goethe   ’s   Weststlicher   Diwan   and   Friedrich   Schlegel   ’s   ber   die   <br> </br>
   Sprache   and   Weisheit   der   Indier   ,   were   based   respectively   on   a   Rhine   journey   and   on   hours   spent   in   Paris   libraries   .   What   German   Oriental   scholarship   did   <br> </br>
   was   to   refine   and   elaborate   techniques   whose   application   was   to   texts   ,   myths   ,   ideas   ,   and   languages   almost   literally   gathered   from   the   Orient   by   imperial   <br> </br>
   Britain   and   France   .
