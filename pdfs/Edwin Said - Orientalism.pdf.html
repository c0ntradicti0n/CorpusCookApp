   The   Latest   Phase   284   7   Acknowledgements   I   have   been   reading   about   Orientalism   for   a   number   of   years   ,   but   most   of   this   book   was   written   during   1975   -   1976   ,   <br> </br>
   which   I   spent   as   a   Fellow   at   the   Center   for   Advanced   Study   in   the   Behavioural   Sciences   ,   Stanfort   ,   California   .   In   this   unique   and   generous   institution   ,   it   <br> </br>
   was   my   good   fortune   not   only   to   have   benefited   agreeably   froms   several   colleagues   ,   but   also   from   the   help   of   Joan   Warmbrunn   ,   Chris   Hoth   ,   Jane   Kielsmeier   ,   <br> </br>

   finally   appeared   as   a   book   ,   perhaps   even   them   ,   Nevertheless   I   should   mention   with   gratitude   the   always   helpful   encouragement   of   Janet   and   Ibrahim   <br> </br>
   Abu-Lughod   ,   Noam   Chomsky   ,   and   Roger   Owen   ,   who   followed   this   project   from   its   beginning   to   its   conclusion   .   Likewise   I   must   gratefully   acknowledge   the   <br> </br>
   helpful   and   critical   interest   of   the   colleagues   ,   friends   ,   and   students   in   various   places   whose   questions   and   discussion   sharpened   the   text   <br> </br>
   considerably   .   <br> </br>

   Marian   Said   helped   me   a   great   deal   with   her   research   on   the   early   modern   history   of   Orientalist   institutions   .   Apart   from   that   ,   though   ,   her   loving   support   <br> </br>

   journalist   wrote   regretfully   of   the   gutted   downtown   area   that   “   it   had   once   seemed   to   belong   to   .   .   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   the   Orient   of   Chateaubriand   and   Nerval.”1   He   was   right   about   the   place   ,   of   course   ,   especially   so   far   as   a   European   was   concerned   .   The   Orient   was   almost   a   <br> </br>
   European   invention   ,   and   had   been   since   antiquity   ‘   a   place   of   romance   ,   exotic   beings   ,   haunting   memories   and   landscapes   ,   remarkable   experiences   .   Now   it   <br> </br>
   was   disappearing   in   a   sense   it   had   happened   ,   its   time   was   over   .   Perhaps   it   seemed   irrelevant   that   Orientals   themselves   had   something   at   stake   in   the   <br> </br>
   process   ,   that   even   in   the   time   of   Chateaubriand   and   Nerval   Orientals   had   lived   there   ,   and   that   now   it   was   they   who   were   suffering   the   main   thing   for   the   <br> </br>
   European   visitor   was   a   European   representation   of   the   Orient   and   its   contemporary   fate   ,   both   of   which   had   a   privileged   communal   significance   for   the   <br> </br>
   journalist   and   his   French   readers   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Americans   will   not   feel   quite   the   same   about   the   Orient   ,   which   for   them   is   much   more   likely   to   be   associated   very   differently   with   the   Far   East   (   China   and   <br> </br>
   Japan   ,   mainly   )   .   Unlike   the   Americans   ,   the   French   and   the   British-less   so   the   Germans   ,   Russians   ,   Spanish   ,   Portuguese   ,   Italians   ,   and   Swiss-have   had   a   <br> </br>
   long   tradition   of   what   I   shall   be   calling   Orientation   a   way   of   coming   to   terms   with   the   Orient   that   is   based   on   the   Orient   ’s   special   place   in   European   Western   <br> </br>
   experience   .   The   Orient   is   not   only   adjacent   to   Europe   it   is   also   the   place   of   Europe   ’s   greatest   and   richest   and   oldest   colonies   ,   the   source   of   its   <br> </br>
   civilizations   and   languages   ,   its   cultural   contestant   ,   and   one   of   its   deepest   and   most   recurring   images   of   the   other   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   addition   ,   the   Orient   has   helped   to   define  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Europe   (   or   the   West   ) </span>  10   as   its   contrasting   image   ,   idea   ,   personality   ,   experience   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   none   of   this   Orient   is   merely   imaginative   .   The   Orient   is   an   integral   of   European   material   civilization   and   culture   .   Orientalism   expresses   and   <br> </br>
   represents   that   part   culturally   and   even   ideologically   as   a   mode   of   discourse   with   supporting   institutions   ,   vocabulary   ,   scholarship   ,   imagery   ,   <br> </br>
   doctrines   ,   even   colonial   bureaucracies   and   colonial   styles   .   In   contrast   ,   the   American   understanding   of   the   Orient   will   seem   considerably   less   dense   ,   <br> </br>
   although   our   recent   Japanese   ,   Korean   ,   and   Indochinese   adventures   ought   now   to   be   creating   a   more   sober   ,   more   realistic   “   Oriental   ”   awareness   .   Moreover   ,   <br> </br>
   the   vastly   expanded   American   political   and   economic   role   in   the   Near   East   (   the   Middle   East   )   makes   great   claims   on   our   understanding   of   that   Orient   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   will   be   clear   to   the   reader   (   and   will   become   clearer   still   throughout   the   many   pages   that   follow   )   that   by   Orientalism   I   mean   several   things   ,   all   of   them   ,   <br> </br>
   in   my   opinion   ,   interdependent   .   The   most   ‘   read   adily   accepted   designation   for   Orientalism   is   an   academic   one   ,   and   indeed   the   label   still   serves   in   a   number   <br> </br>
   of   academic   institutions   .   Anyone   who   teaches   ,   writes   about   ,   or   researches   the   Orient-and   this   applies   whether   the   person   is   an   anthropologist   ,   <br> </br>
   sociologist   ,   historian   ,   or   philologist-either   in   its   specific   or   its   general   aspects   ,   is   an   Orientalist   ,   and   what   he   or   she   does   is   Orientalism   .   <br> </br>
   Compared   with   Oriental   studies   or   area   studies   ,   it   is   true   that   the   term   Orientalism   is   less   preferred   by   specialists   today   ,   both   because   it   is   too   vague   <br> </br>
   and   general   and   because   it   connotes   the   high-handed   executive   attitude   of   nineteenth-century   and   early   twentieth-century   European   colonialism   .   <br> </br>
   Nevertheless   books   are   written   and   congresses   held   with   “   the   Orient   ”   as   their   main   focus   ,   with   the   Orientalist   in   his   new   or   old   guise   as   their   main   <br> </br>
   authority   .   The   point   is   that   even   if   it   does   not   survive   as   it   once   did   ,   Orientalism   lives   on   academically   through   its   doctrines   and   theses   about   the   Orient   <br> </br>
   and   the   Oriental   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Related   to   this   academic   tradition   ,   whose   fortunes   ,   transmigrations   ,   specializations   ,   and   transmissions   are   in   part   the   subject   of   this   study   ,   is   a   <br> </br>
   more   general   meaning   for   Orientalism   .   Orientalism   is   a   style   of   thought   based   upon   an   ontological   and   epistemological   distinction   made   between  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> “   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Orient   ”   and   (   most   of   the   time   ) </span>  “   the   Occident   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ”   Thus   a   very   large   mass   of   writers   ,   among   whom   are   poets   ,   novelists   ,   philosophers   ,   political   theorists   ,   economists   ,   and   imperial   administrators   ,   have   <br> </br>
   accepted   the   basic   distinction   between   East   and   West   as   the   starting   point   for   elaborate   theories   ,   epics   ,   novels   ,   epics   ,   social   descriptions   and   <br> </br>
   political   accounts   concerning   the   11   Orient   ,   its   people   ,   customs   ,   “   mind   ,   ”   destiny   ,   and   so   on   .   This   Orientalism   can   accommodate   Aeschylus   ,   say   ,   and   <br> </br>
   Victor   Hugo   ,   Dante   and   Karl   Marx   .   A   little   later   in   this   introduction   I   shall   deal   with   the   methodological   problems   one   encounters   in   so   broadly   construed   <br> </br>
   a   “   field   ”   as   this   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   inter   change   between   the   academic   and   the   more   or   less   imaginative   meaning   of   Orientalism   is   a   constant   one   ,   and   since   the   late   eighteenth   century   <br> </br>
   there   has   been   a   considerable   ,   quite   disciplined-perhaps   even   regulated-traffic   between   the   two   .   Here   I   come   to   the   third   meaning   of   Orientalism   ,   which   <br> </br>
   is   something   more   historically   and   materially   defined   than   either   of   the   other   two   .   Taking   the   late   eighteenth   century   as   a   very   roughly   defined   starting   <br> </br>
   point   Orientalism   can   be   discussed   and   analyzed   as   the   corporate   institution   for   dealing   with   the   Orientdealing   with   it   by   making   statements   about   it   ,   <br> </br>
   authorizing   views   of   it   ,   describing   it   ,   by   teaching   it   settling   it   ,   ruling   over   it   :   in   short   ,   Orientalism   as   a   Western   style   for   dominating   restructuring   <br> </br>
   ,   and   having   authority   over   the   Orient   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   found   it   useful   here   to   employ   is   a   Foucault   ’s   notion   of   a   discourse   ,   as   described   by   him   in   The   Archaeology   of   Knowledge   and   in   Discipline   and   Punish   ,   <br> </br>
   to   identify   Orientalism   .   My   contention   is   that   without   examining   Orientalism   as   a   discourse   one   can   not   possibly   understand   the   enormously   systematic   <br> </br>
   discipline   by   which   European   culture   was   able   to   manage-and   even   produce-the   Orient   politically   ,   sociologically   ,   militarily   ,   ideologically   ,   <br> </br>
   scientifically   ,   and   imaginatively   during   the   post-Enlightenment   period   .   Moreover   ,   so   authoritative   a   position   did   Orientalism   have   that   I   believe   no   <br> </br>
   one   writing   ,   thinking   ,   or   acting   on   the   Orient   could   do   so   without   taking   account   of   the   limitations   on   thought   and   action   imposed   by   Orientalism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   brief   ,   because   of  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Orientalism   the   Orient   was   not   (   and   is   not   ) </span>  a   free   subject   of   thought   or   action   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   is   not   to   say   that   Orientalism   unilaterally   determines   what   can   be   said   about   the   Orient   ,   but   that   it   is   the-whole   network   of   interests   inevitably   <br> </br>
   brought   to   bear   on   (   and   therefore   always   involved   )   any   occasion   when   that   peculiar   entity   “   the   Orient   ”   is   in   question   .   How   this   happens   is   what   this   book   <br> </br>
   tries   to   demonstrate   .   It   also   tries   to   show   that   European   culture   gained   in   strength   and   identity   by   setting   itself   off   against   the   Orient   as   a   sort   of   <br> </br>
   surrogate   an   even   underground   self   .   ,   Historically   and   culturally   there   is   a   quantitative   as   well   as   a   qualitative   difference   between   the   <br> </br>
   Franco-British   involvement   in   the   Orient   and-until   the   period   of   American   ascendancy   after   12   World   War   II-the   involvement   of   every   other   European   and   <br> </br>
   Atlantic   power   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   speak   of   Orientalism   therefore   is   to   speak   mainly   ,   although   not   exclusively   ,   of   a   British   and   French   cultural   enterprise   a   project   whose   dimensions   <br> </br>
   take   in   such   disparate   realms   as   the   imagination   itself   ,   the   whole   of   India   and   the   Levant   ,   the   Biblical   texts   and   the   Biblical   lands   ,   the   spice   trade   ,   <br> </br>
   colonial   armies   and   a   long   tradition   of   colonial   administrators   ,   a   formidable   scholarly   corpus   ,   innumerable   Oriental   “   experts   ”   and   “   hands   ,   ”   an   <br> </br>
   Oriental   professorate   ,   a   complex   array   of   “   Oriental   ”   ideas   (   Oriental   despotism   ,   Oriental   splendor   ,   cruelt   ,   sensuality   )   ,   many   Eastern   sects   ,   <br> </br>
   philosophies   ,   and   wisdoms   domesticated   for   local   European   use-the   list   can   be   extended   more   or   less   indefinitely   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   point   is   that   Orientalism   derives   from   a   particular   closeness   experienced   between   Britain   and   France   and   the   Orient   ,   which   until   the   early   nineteenth   <br> </br>
   century   had   really   meant   only   India   and   the   Bible   lands   .   From   the   beginning   of   the   nineteenth   century   until   the   end   of   World   War   II   France   and   Britain   <br> </br>
   dominated   the   Orient   and   Orientalism   since   World   War   II   America   has   dominated   the   Orient   ,   and   approaches   it   as   France   and   Britain   once   did   .   Out   of   that   <br> </br>
   closeness   whose   dynamic   is   enormously   productive   even   if   it   always   demonstrates   the   comparatively   greater   strength   of  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Occident </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   British   ,   French   , </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> or   American   ) </span>  ,   comes   the   large   body   of   texts   I   call   Orientalist   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   should   be   said   at   once   that   even   with   the   generous   number   of   books   and   authors   that   I   examine   ,   there   is   a   much   larger   number   that   I   simply   have   had   to   leave   <br> </br>
   out   .   My   argument   ,   however   ,   depends   neither   upon   an   exhaustive   catalogue   of   texts   dealing   with   the   Orient   nor   upon   a   clearly   delimited   set   of   texts   ,   <br> </br>
   authors   ,   and   ideas   that   together   make   up   the   Orientalist   canon   .   I   have   depended   instead   upon   a   different   methodological   alternative-whose   backbone   in   a   <br> </br>
   sense   is   the   set   of   historical   generalizations   I   have   so   far   been   making   in   this   Introduction-and   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   it   is   these   I   want   now   to   discuss   in   more   analytical   detail   .   II   I   have   begun   with   the   assumption   that   the   Orient   is   not   an   inert   fact   of   nature   .   It   is   not   merely   <br> </br>
   there   ,   just   as   the   Occident   itself   is   not   just   there   either   :   We   must   take   seriously   Vico   ’s   great   observation   13   that   men   make   their   own   history   ,   that   what   <br> </br>
   they   can   know   is   what   they   have   made   ,   and   extend   it   to   geography   :   as   both   geographical   and   cultural   entities-to   say   nothing   of   historical   entities   -such   <br> </br>
   locales   ,   regions   geographical   sectors   as   “   Orient   ”   and   “   Occident   ”   are   man-made   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Therefore   as   much   as   the   West   itself   ,   the   Orient   is   an   idea   that   has   a   history   and   a   tradition   of   thought   ,   imagery   ,   and   vocabulary   that   have   given   it   reality   <br> </br>
   and   presence   in   and   for   the   West   .   The   two   geographical   entities   thus   support   and   to   an   extent   reflect   each   other   .   Having   said   that   ,   one   must   go   on   to   state   a   <br> </br>
   number   of   reasonable   qualifications   .   In   the   first   place   ,   it   would   be   wrong   to   conclude   that   the   Orient   was   essentially   an   idea   ,   or   a   creation   with   no   <br> </br>
   corresponding   reality   .   When   Disraeli   said   in   his   novel   Tancred   that   the   East   was   a   career   ,   he   meant   that   to   be   interested   in   the   East   was   something   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   bright   young   Westerners   would   find   to   be   an   all   consuming   passion   he   should   not   be   interpreted   as   saying   that   the   East   was   only   a   career   for   Westerners   .   <br> </br>
   There   were-and   are-   cultures   and   nations   whose   location   is   in   the   East   ,   and   their   lives   ,   histories   ,   and   customs   have   a   brute   reality   obviously   greater   <br> </br>
   than   anything   that   could   be   said   about   them   in   the   West   .   About   that   fact   this   study   of   Orientalism   has   very   little   to   contribute   ,   except   to   acknowledge   it   <br> </br>
   tacitly   .   But   the   phenomenon   of   Orientalism   as   I   study   it   here   deals   principally   ,   not   with   a   correspondence   between   Orientalism   and   Orient   ,   but   with   the   <br> </br>
   internal   consistency   of   Orientalism   and   its   ideas   about  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Orient </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   the   East   as   career   ) </span>  despite   or   beyond   any   correspondence   ,   or   lack   thereof   ,   with   a   “   <br> </br>
   real   ”   Orient   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   point   is   that   Disraeli   ’s   statement   about   the   East   refers   mainly   to   that   created   consistency   ,   that   regular   constellation   of   ideas   as   the   pre-eminent   <br> </br>
   thing   about   the   Orient   ,   and   not   to   its   mere   being   ,   as   Wallace   Stevens   ’s   phrase   has   it   .   A   second   qualification   is   that   ideas   ,   cultures   ,   and   histories   can   not   <br> </br>
   seriously   be   understood   or   studied   without   their   force   ,   or   more   precisely   their   configurations   of   power   ,   also   being   studied   .   To   believe   that   the   Orient   <br> </br>
   was   created-or   ,   as   I   call   it   ,   “   Orientalized   ”   -and   to   believe   that   such   things   happen   simply   as   a   necessity   of   the   imagination   ,   is   to   be   disingenuous   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   relationship   between   Occident   and   Orient   is   a   relationship   of   power   ,   of   domination   ,   of   varying   degrees   of   a   compex   hegemony   an   is   quite   accurately   <br> </br>
   indicated   in   the   title   of   K.   M.   Panikkar   ’s   classic   Asia   and   Western   Dominance   .   ’   The   Orient   was   Orientalized   not   only   because   it   was   discovered   to   be   “   <br> </br>
   Oriental   ”   in   all   those   ways   considered   common-   14   place   by   an   average   nineteenth-century   European   ,   but   also   because   it   could   be-that   is   ,   submitted   to   <br> </br>
   being-made   Oriental   .   There   is   very   little   consent   to   be   found   ,   for   example   ,   in   the   fact   that   Flau-   bert   ’s   encounter   with   an   Egyptian   courtesan   produced   a   <br> </br>
   widely   in   fluential   model   of   the   Oriental   woman   she   never   spoke   of   herself   ,   she   never   represented   her   emotions   ,   presence   ,   or   history   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   He   spoke   for   and   represented   her   .   He   was   foreign   ,   comparatively   wealthy   ,   male   ,   and   these   were   historical   facts   of   domination   that   allowed   him   not   only   to   <br> </br>
   possess   Kuchuk   Hanem   physically   but   to   speak   for   her   and   tell   his   readers   in   what   way   she   was   “   typically   Oriental   .   ”   My   argument   is   that   Flaubert   ’s   <br> </br>
   situation   of   strength   in   relation   to   Kuchuk   Hanem   was   not   an   isolated   instance   .   It   fairly   stands   for   the   pattern   of   relative   strength   between   East   and   West   <br> </br>
   ,   and   the   discourse   about   the   Orient   that   it   enabled   .   This   brings   us   to   a   third   qualification   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   ought   never   to   assume   that   the   structure   of   Orientalism   is   nothing   more   an   a   structure   of   lies   or   of   myths   which   were   the   truth   about   them   to   be   told   ,   would   <br> </br>
   simply   blow   away   .   I   myself   believe   that   Orientalism   is   more   particularly   valuable   as   a   sign   of   European-Atlantic   power   over   the   Orient   then   it   is   as   a   <br> </br>
   veridic   discourse   about   the   Orient   (   which   is   what   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> in   its   academic   or   scholarly   form   ,   it   claims   to </span>  be   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Never   theless   ,   what   we   must   respect   and   try   to   grasp   is   the   sheer   knitted   together   strength   of   Orientalist   discourse   ,   its   very   close   ties   to   the   enabling   <br> </br>
   socio-economic   and   political   institutions   ,   and   its   redoubt-   able   durability   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   After   all   ,   any   system   of   ideas   that   can   remain   unchanged   as  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> teachable </span></span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> wisdom </span></span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> in </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> academies </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> , </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> books </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> , </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> congresses </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> , </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> universities </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> , </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> foreign-service </span></span></span>  <br> </br>

   collection   of   .   lies   .   Orientalism   ,   therefore   ,   is   not   an   airy   European   fantasy   about   the   Orient   but   a   created   body   of   theory   and   practice   in   which   ,   for   many   <br> </br>
   rations   ,   there   has   been   a   considerable   material   investment   .   Continued   investment   made   Orientalism   ,   as   a   system   of   knowledge   about   the   Orient   ,   an   <br> </br>
   accepted   grid   for   filtering   through   the   Orient   into   Western   consciousness   ,   just   as   that   same   investment   multiplied-indeed   ,   made   truly   productive-the   <br> </br>
   statements   proliferating   out   from   Orientalism   into   the   general   culture   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Gramsci   has   made   the   useful   analytic   distinction   between   civil   and   political   society   in   which   the   former   is   made   up   of  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> voluntary </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   or   atleast   rational   and </span>  <br> </br>

   .   In   any   society   not   totalitarian   ,   then   ,   certain   cultural   forms   predominate   over   others   ,   just   as   certain   ideas   are   more   in-   fluential   than   others   the   form   <br> </br>
   of   this   cultural   leadership   is   what   Gramsci   has   identified   as   hegemony   ,   an   indispensable   concept   for   any   understanding   of   cultural   life   in   the   <br> </br>
   industrial   West   .   It   is   hegemony   ,   or   rather   the   result   of   cultural   hegemony   at   work   ,   that   gives   Orientalism   the   durability   and   the   strength   I   have   been   <br> </br>
   speaking   about   so   far   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Orientalism   is   never   far   from   what   Denys   Hay   has   called   the   idea   of   Europe,3   a   collective   notion   identifying   “   us   ”   Europeans   as   against   all   “   those   ”   <br> </br>
   non-Europeans   ,   and   indeed   it   can   be   argued   that   the   major   component   in   European   culture   is   precisely   what   made   that   culture   hegemonic   both   in   and   outside   <br> </br>
   Europe   :   the   idea   of   European   identiy   as   a   superior   one   in   comparison   with   all   the   non-European   peoples   and   cultures   .   There   is   in   addition   the   hegemony   of   <br> </br>
   European   ideas   about   the   Orient   ,   themselves   reiterating   European   superiority   over   Orental   backwardness   usually   overriding   the   possibility   that   a   <br> </br>
   more   independent   ,   or   more   skeptical   ,   thinker   might   have   had   different   views   on   the   matter   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   a   quite   constant   way   ,   Orientalism   depends   for   its   strategy   on   this   flexible   positional   superiority   ,   which   puts   the   Westerner   in   a   whole   series   of   <br> </br>
   possible   relationships   with   the   Orient   without   ever   losing   him   the   relative   upper   hand   .   And   why   should   it   have   been   otherwise   ,   especially   during   the   <br> </br>
   period   of   extraordinary   European   ascendancy   from   the   late   Renaissance   to   the   present   ?
