   <br> </br>
   Each   code   block   in   this   chapter   references   which   app   version   it   is   contained   within   .   We   can   copy   and   paste   longer   code   insertions   from   these   app   versions   <br> </br>

   submission   objects   ,   we   ’re   going   to   use   Vue   ’s   native   v-for   directive   .   v-for   directive   The   v-for   directive   is   used   to   render   a   list   of   items   based   on   a   data   <br> </br>
   source   .   In   our   case   ,   we   would   like   to   render   a   submission   post   for   each   of   the   submission   objects   in   our   Seeds.submission   array   .   The   article   element   in   the   <br> </br>
   index.html   file   ,   which   is   a   standard   HTML   element   ,   currently   displays   a   single   submission   post   :   article   The   v-for   directive   requires   a   specific   syntax   <br> </br>
   along   the   lines   of   item   in   items   ,   where   items   is   a   data   collection   and   item   is   an   alias   for   every   element   that   is   being   iterated   upon   :   article   key   article   If   <br> </br>
   there   were   any   dynamic   changes   made   to   a   v-for   list   without   the   key   attribute   ,   Vue   will   opt   towards   changing   data   within   each   element   instead   of   moving   the   <br> </br>
   DOM   elements   accordingly   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   By   specifying   a   unique   key   attribute   to   each   iterated   item   ,   we   ’re   now   telling   Vue   to   reorder   elements   if   needed   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Vue   docs26 </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> explains   the   importance   of </span>  <br> </br>

   can   use   the   v-on   :   click   directive   to   implement   a   click   handler   .   We   can   specify   this   click   handler   on   an   up-vote   icon   of   a   submission   .   We   ’ll   set   this   click   <br> </br>
