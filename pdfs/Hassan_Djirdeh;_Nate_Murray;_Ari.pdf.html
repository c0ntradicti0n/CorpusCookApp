   twitter.comfullstackio   Foreword   Front-end   web   development   has   become   astoundingly   complex   .   If   you   ’ve   never   used   a   modern   JavaScript   framework   ,   <br> </br>
   building   your   first   app   that   just   displays   “   Hello   ”   can   take   a   whole   week   !   That   might   sound   ridiculous   ,   but   most   frameworks   assume   knowledge   of   the   <br> </br>
   terminal   ,   advanced   JavaScript   ,   and   tools   such   as   the   Node   Package   Manager   (   NPM   )   ,   Babel   ,   Webpack   ,   and   sometimes   more   .   Chris   Fritz   -   Vue   Core   Team   Vue   ,   <br> </br>
   refreshingly   ,   does   n’t   assume   .   We   call   it   the   “   pro-   gressive   ”   JavaScript   framework   because   it   scales   down   as   well   as   it   scales   up   .   If   your   app   is   simple   ,   you   <br> </br>
   can   use   Vue   just   like   jQuery   -   by   dropping   in   a   script   tag   .   But   as   your   skills   and   needs   grow   more   advanced   ,   Vue   grows   with   you   to   make   you   more   powerful   and   <br> </br>
   productive   .   Hassan   provides   a   catalyst   for   that   growth   in   this   book   .   Through   project-driven   learning   ,   he   ’ll   guide   you   from   the   simplest   examples   <br> </br>
   through   the   necessary   skills   for   large-scale   ,   enterprise   applications   .   Along   the   way   ,   you   ’ll   learn   not   only   how   to   solve   a   variety   of   problems   with   Vue   ,   <br> </br>
   but   also   the   concepts   and   tools   that   have   be-   come   industry   standards   no   matter   what   framework   you   use   .   Welcome   to   the   community   ,   have   fun   ,   and   enjoy   the   Vue   <br> </br>

   the   Most   Out   of   This   Book   Overview   This   book   aims   to   be   the   single   most   useful   resource   on   learning   Vue.js   .   By   the   time   you   ’re   done   reading   this   book   ,   you   (   and   <br> </br>
   your   team   )   will   have   everything   you   need   to   build   reliable   ,   powerful   Vue   applications   .   Vue   is   built   on   the   premise   of   simplicity   by   being   designed   from   the   <br> </br>
   ground   up   to   be   incrementally   adoptable   .   After   the   first   few   chapters   ,   you   ’ll   have   a   solid   understanding   of   Vue   ’s   fundamentals   and   will   be   able   to   build   a   <br> </br>
   wide   array   of   rich   ,   interactive   web   apps   with   the   framework   .   But   beyond   Vue   ’s   core   ,   there   are   tools   and   libraries   that   exist   in   the   Vue   ecosystem   that   ’s   <br> </br>
   often   needed   to   build   real-world   production   scale   applications   .   Things   like   client-side   routing   between   pages   ,   managing   complex   state   ,   and   heavy   API   <br> </br>
   interaction   at   scale   .   This   book   can   be   broken   down   into   two   parts   .   In   Part   I   ,   we   cover   all   the   fundamentals   with   a   progressive   ,   example-driven   approach   .   <br> </br>
   You   ’ll   first   introduce   Vue   through   a   Content   Delivery   Network   (   CDN   )   before   moving   towards   building   within   Webpack   bundled   applications   .   You   ’ll   gain   a   <br> </br>
   grasp   of   handling   user   interaction   ,   working   with   single-file   components   ,   understanding   simple   state   management   ,   and   how   custom   events   work   .   We   <br> </br>
   bookend   the   first   part   by   introducing   Vuex   and   how   Vuex   is   integrated   to   manage   overall   application   data   architecture   .   Part   II   of   this   book   moves   into   more   <br> </br>
   advanced   concepts   that   you   ’ll   often   see   used   in   large   ,   production   applications   .   We   ’ll   integrate   Vuex   to   a   server-persisted   app   ,   manage   rich   forms   ,   <br> </br>
   build   a   multi-page   app   that   uses   client-side   routing   ,   and   finally   explore   how   unit   tests   can   be   written   with   Vue   ’s   official   unit   testing   library   .   First   ,   <br> </br>
   know   that   you   do   not   need   to   read   this   book   linearly   from   cover-to-cover   .   However   ,   we   ’ve   ordered   the   contents   of   the   book   in   a   way   we   feel   fits   the   order   you   <br> </br>
   should   learn   the   concepts   .   Some   sections   in   Part   II   assume   you   ’ve   acquired   certain   fundamental   concepts   from   Part   I.   As   a   result   ,   we   encourage   you   to   learn   <br> </br>
   all   the   concepts   in   Part   I   of   the   book   first   before   diving   into   concepts   in   Part   II   .   Second   ,   keep   in   mind   this   package   is   more   than   just   a   book   -   it   ’s   a   course   <br> </br>
   complete   with   example   code   for   every   chapter   .   Below   ,   we   ’ll   tell   you   :   how   to   approach   the   code   examples   and   how   to   get   help   if   something   goes   wrong   How   to   Get   <br> </br>
   the   Most   Out   of   This   Book   2   Vue   2.x   In   Sept.   20163   ,   the   Vue   framework   was   rewritten   and   released   as   version   2.0   .   Vue   2.0   introduced   new   concepts   such   as   the   <br> </br>
   Virual   DOM   ,   render   functions   ,   and   server-side   rendering   capabilities   .   In   addition   ,   version   2.0   was   rewritten   to   provide   significant   performance   <br> </br>
   improvements   over   v1   .   This   book   covers   ,   and   will   always   cover   ,   the   latest   release   of   Vue   -   which   is   currently   labelled   as   version   2.x   .   Running   Code   <br> </br>
   Examples   This   book   comes   with   a   library   of   runnable   code   examples   .   The   code   is   available   to   download   from   the   same   place   where   you   purchased   this   book   .   If   <br> </br>
   you   have   any   trouble   finding   or   downloading   the   code   examples   ,   email   us   at   vuefullstack.io   .   Webpack   projects   For   Webpack-bundled   projects   ,   we   use   the   <br> </br>
   program   npm4   to   run   examples   .   You   can   install   the   application   dependencies   with   :   npm   install   And   boot   apps   with   one   of   the   following   commands   :   npm   run   <br> </br>
   start   or   npm   run   serve   With   every   chapter   ,   we   ’ll   reiterate   the   commands   necessary   to   install   application   dependancies   and   boot   example   code   .   After   <br> </br>
   running   npm   run   start   or   npm   run   serve   ,   you   will   see   some   output   on   your   screen   that   will   tell   you   what   URL   to   open   to   view   your   app   .   If   you   ’re   unfamiliar   with   <br> </br>
   npm   ,   we   cover   how   to   get   it   installed   in   the   “   Setting   Up   ”   section   in   the   second   chapter   .   If   you   ’re   ever   unclear   on   how   to   run   a   particular   sample   app   ,   checkout   <br> </br>
   the   README.md   in   that   project   ’s   directory   .   EveryWebpack   bundled   sample   project   contains   a   README.md   that   will   give   you   the   instructions   you   need   to   run   <br> </br>

   Include   For   simpler   examples   ,   we   ’ve   resorted   to   directly   including   the   Vue   library   from   a   Content   Delivery   Network   (   CDN   )   to   get   the   app   up   and   running   as   <br> </br>
   fast   as   possible   .   In   this   book   ,   applications   that   introduce   Vue   from   a   CDN   often   consist   of   a   single   HTML   file   (   index.html   )   for   markup   and   a   single   JS   file   (   <br> </br>
   main.js   )   for   all   Vue   code   .   With   these   examples   ,   we   ’ll   be   able   to   run   the   app   by   opening   the   index.html   file   in   our   browser   (   e.g.   right   click   index.html   file   <br> </br>
   and   select   Open   With   Google   Chrome   )   .   Since   the   Vue   library   is   hosted   externally   in   these   cases   ,   these   examples   will   require   your   machine   to   be   connected   to   <br> </br>
   the   internet   .   Code   Blocks   and   Context   The   majority   of   code   blocks   in   this   book   is   pulled   from   a   runnable   code   example   which   you   can   find   in   the   sample   code   .   <br> </br>
   For   example   ,   here   is   a   code   block   pulled   from   the   first   chapter   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   new   Vue   (   el   :   app   ,   data   :   submissions   :   Seed.submissions   ,   computed   :   <br> </br>
   sortedSubmissions   (   )   return   this.submissions.sort((a   ,   b   )   return   b.votes   -   a.votes   )   ;   ,   components   :   submission-component   :   submissionComponent   )   ;   <br> </br>
   Notice   that   the   header   of   this   code   block   states   the   path   to   the   file   which   contains   this   code   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   .   Certain   code   examples   will   resemble   <br> </br>
   building   blocks   to   get   to   a   certain   point   and   thus   may   not   reflect   a   code   block   directly   from   the   sample   code   .   If   you   ever   feel   like   you   ’re   missing   the   context   <br> </br>
   for   a   code   example   ,   open   up   the   full   code   file   using   your   favorite   text   editor   .   This   book   is   written   with   the   expectation   that   you   ’ll   also   be   looking   at   the   <br> </br>
   example   code   alongside   the   manuscript   .   For   example   ,   we   often   need   to   import   libraries   to   get   our   code   to   run   .   In   the   early   chapters   of   the   book   we   show   these   <br> </br>
   import   statements   ,   because   it   ’s   not   clear   where   the   libraries   are   coming   from   How   to   Get   the   Most   Out   of   This   Book   4   otherwise   .   However   ,   the   later   chapters   <br> </br>
   of   the   book   aremore   advanced   and   they   focus   on   key   concepts   instead   of   repeating   boilerplate   code   that   was   covered   earlier   in   the   book   .   If   at   any   point   you   <br> </br>
   ’re   not   clear   on   the   context   ,   open   up   the   code   example   on   disk   .   Code   Block   Numbering   In   this   book   ,   we   mostly   build   larger   examples   in   steps   .   If   you   see   a   file   <br> </br>
   being   loaded   that   has   a   numeric   suffix   ,   that   generally   means   we   ’re   building   up   to   something   bigger   .   For   instance   ,   the   code   block   above   has   the   file   path   :   <br> </br>
   upvoteapp_5main.js   .   When   you   see   the   -N.js   syntax   ,   that   means   we   ’re   building   up   to   a   final   version   of   the   file   .   You   can   jump   into   that   file   and   see   the   state   <br> </br>
   of   all   the   code   at   that   particular   stage   .   Instruction   for   Windows   users   All   the   code   in   this   book   has   been   tested   on   a   Windows   machine   .   If   you   have   any   issues   <br> </br>
   running   the   code   on   Windows   ,   send   us   an   email5   and   we   ’ll   try   to   help   you   get   it   resolved   .   Ensure   Node.js   and   npm   are   installed   If   you   ’re   on   a   Windows   machine   <br> </br>
   and   have   yet   to   do   any   web   development   on   it   ,   you   can   install   the   Node.js   Windows   Installer   from   the   Node.js6   website   .   With   Node.js   (   and   npm   )   appropriately   <br> </br>
   installed   ,   you   should   be   able   to   start   the   Webpack-bundled   Node.js   projects   in   the   book   as   expected   .   See   this   tutorial7   for   installing   Node.js   and   npm   on   <br> </br>
   Windows   .   Getting   Help   While   we   ’ve   made   every   effort   to   be   clear   ,   precise   ,   and   accurate   you   may   find   that   when   you   ’re   writing   your   code   you   run   into   a   problem   <br> </br>
   .   Generally   ,   there   are   three   types   of   problems   :   A   “   bug   ”   in   the   book   (   e.g.   how   we   describe   something   is   wrong   )   A   “   bug   ”   in   our   code   A   “   bug   ”   in   your   code   <br> </br>

   Application   Building   UpVote   !   On   our   first   step   to   learning   Vue   ,   we   ’re   going   to   build   a   simple   voting   application   (   named   UpVote   !   )   that   takes   inspiration   <br> </br>
   from   popular   social   feed   websites   like   Reddit10   and   Hacker   News11   .   Completed   version   of   the   app   UpVote   !   focuses   on   displaying   a   list   of   submissions   that   <br> </br>
   users   can   vote   on   .   Each   submission   will   present   some   information   about   itself   like   an   image   ,   title   ,   and   description   .   All   submissions   are   sorted   <br> </br>
   instantaneously   by   number   of   votes   .   The   up-vote   icon   in   each   submissionwill   allow   users   to   increase   vote   numbers   and   subsequently   rearrange   submission   <br> </br>
   layout   .   With   UpVote   !   ,   we   ’ll   become   familiar   with   how   Vue   approaches   front-end   development   by   under-   standing   the   basic   fundamentals   associated   with   <br> </br>
   the   library   .   By   the   end   of   the   chapter   we   ’ll   be   well   on   our   way   to   building   dynamic   front-end   interfaces   thanks   to   Vue   ’s   simplicity   !   10https   :   reddit.com   <br> </br>

   Development   environment   setup   Code   editor   Regardless   of   experience   ,   whenever   developing   for   the   web   ,   we   ’ll   need   a   code   editor   to   write   our   application   (   <br> </br>
   this   is   true   for   all   code   in   this   book   )   .   It   ’s   most   important   to   be   comfortable   with   your   code   editor   ,   so   if   you   have   one   you   like   ,   stick   with   it   .   If   not   ,   we   <br> </br>
   recommend   Atom12   ,   Sublime   Text   313   ,   or   Visual   Studio   Code14   .   Development   Environment   For   this   chapter   ,   we   ’ll   focus   on   getting   our   Vue   app   up   and   running   <br> </br>
   as   fast   as   possible   ,   so   we   ’ll   simply   introduce   Vue   through   a   Content   Delivery   Network   (   CDN   )   .   We   ’ll   take   a   deeper   look   into   installing   all   the   necessary   <br> </br>
   libraries   for   our   development   environment   in   the   next   chapter   .   Browser   We   highly   recommend   using   the   Google   Chrome   Web   Browser15   to   develop   Vue   apps   <br> </br>
   since   we   ’ll   be   using   the   Chrome   developer   toolkit16   throughout   this   book   .   To   follow   along   with   our   development   and   debugging   ,   we   recommend   installing   <br> </br>
   Chrome   ,   if   not   installed   already   .   With   Chrome   ,   Vue   provides   an   incredibly   useful   extension   ,   Vue.js   devtools17   that   simplifies   debugging   of   Vue   <br> </br>
   applications   .   We   ’ll   be   using   the   devtools   at   separate   points   throughout   the   book   so   we   encourage   you   to   install   it   as   well   .   Note   :   With   certain   chapters   in   <br> </br>
   this   book   (   like   this   chapter   for   example   )   ,   we   ’ll   be   working   with   applications   opened   via   file   :   protocol   .   To   make   the   Vue   devtools   work   for   these   pages   ,   you   <br> </br>
   ’ll   need   to   check   “   Allow   access   to   file   URLs   ”   for   the   extension   in   Chrome   ’s   extension   manager   :   Allow   access   to   file   URLs   I   -   Your   first   Vue.js   Web   <br> </br>
   Application   8   JavaScript   ES6ES7   JavaScript   is   the   language   of   the   web   .   It   runs   on   many   different   browsers   ,   including   Google   Chrome   ,   Firefox   ,   Safari   ,   <br> </br>
   Microsoft   Edge   ,   and   Internet   Explorer   .   Different   browsers   have   different   JavaScript   interpreters   which   execute   JavaScript   code   .   Its   widespread   <br> </br>
   adoption   as   the   Internet   ’s   client-side   scripting   language   led   to   the   formation   of   a   standards   body   which   manages   its   specification   .   The   specification   <br> </br>
   is   called   ECMAScript   or   ES   .   The   5th   edition   of   the   specification   is   called   ES5   .   We   think   of   ES5   as   a   “   version   ”   of   the   JavaScript   programming   language   .   <br> </br>
   Finalized   in   2009   ,   ES5   was   adopted   by   all   major   browsers   within   a   few   years   .   The   6th   edition   of   JavaScript   is   referred   to   as   ES6   .   Finalized   in   2015   ,   the   <br> </br>
   latest   versions   of   major   browsers   are   still   finishing   adding   support   for   ES6   as   of   2017   .   ES6   provides   a   significant   update   .   It   contains   a   whole   host   of   new   <br> </br>
   features   for   JavaScript   ,   almost   two   dozen   in   total   .   JavaScript   written   in   ES6   is   tangibly   different   than   JavaScript   written   in   ES5   .   ES7   ,   a   much   smaller   <br> </br>
   update   that   builds   on   ES6   ,   was   ratified   in   June   2016   .   ES7   contains   only   two   new   features   .   To   take   advantage   of   the   future   versions   of   JavaScript   ,   we   want   to   <br> </br>
   write   our   code   in   ES6ES7   today   .   We   ’ll   also   want   our   JavaScript   to   run   on   older   browsers   until   they   fade   out   of   widespread   use   .   This   book   is   written   using   the   <br> </br>
   JavaScript   ES7   version   .   As   ES6   ratified   a   majority   of   these   new   features   ,   we   ’ll   commonly   refer   to   these   new   features   as   ES6   features   .   ES6   is   sometimes   <br> </br>
   referred   to   as   ES2015   ,   the   year   of   its   finalization   .   ES7   ,   in   turn   ,   is   often   referred   to   as   ES2016   .   Getting   started   Sample   Code   All   the   code   <br> </br>

   ’ll   see   completed   versions   of   the   apps   as   well   as   boilerplates   to   help   us   get   started   .   Each   chapter   provides   detailed   instruction   on   how   to   follow   along   on   <br> </br>
   our   own   .   While   coding   along   with   the   book   is   not   necessary   ,   we   highly   recommend   doing   so   .   Playing   around   with   examples   and   sample   code   will   help   solidify   <br> </br>

   and   paste   longer   code   insertions   from   these   app   versions   into   our   local   app   folder   ,   the   starting   point   of   our   application   .   The   public   sub-folder   hosts   all   <br> </br>
