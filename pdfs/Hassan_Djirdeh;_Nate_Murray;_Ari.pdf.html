   development   has   become   astoundingly   complex   .   If   you   ’ve   never   used   a   modern   JavaScript   framework   ,   building   your   first   app   that   just   displays   “   Hello   ”   can   <br> </br>
   take   a   whole   week   !   That   might   sound   ridiculous   ,   but   most   frameworks   assume   knowledge   of   the   terminal   ,   advanced   JavaScript   ,   and   tools   such   as   the   Node   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Package </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Manager </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   NPM   ) </span>  ,   Babel   ,   Webpack   ,   and   sometimes   more   .   <br> </br>

   Chris   Fritz   -   Vue   Core   Team   Vue   ,   refreshingly   ,   does   n’t   assume   .   We   call   it   the   “   pro-   gressive   ”   JavaScript   framework   because   it   scales   down   as   well   as   it   <br> </br>
   scales   up   .   If   your   app   is   simple   ,   you   can   use   Vue   just   like   jQuery   -   by   dropping   in   a   script   tag   .   But   as   your   skills   and   needs   grow   more   advanced   ,   Vue   grows   with   <br> </br>
   you   to   make   you   more   powerful   and   productive   .   Hassan   provides   a   catalyst   for   that   growth   in   this   book   .   Through   project-driven   learning   ,   he   ’ll   guide   you   <br> </br>
   from   the   simplest   examples   through   the   necessary   skills   for   large-scale   ,   enterprise   applications   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Along   the   way   ,   you   ’ll   learn   not   only   how   to   solve   a   variety   of   problems   with   Vue   ,   but   also   the   concepts   and   tools   that   have   be-   come   industry   standards   no   <br> </br>

   the   single   most   useful   resource   on   learning   Vue.js   .   By   the   time   you   ’re   done   reading   this   book   ,   you  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   and   your   team   ) </span>  will   have   everything   you   need   to   build   <br> </br>
   reliable   ,   powerful   Vue   applications   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Vue   is   built   on   the   premise   of   simplicity   by   being   designed   from   the   ground   up   to   be   incrementally   adoptable   .   After   the   first   few   chapters   ,   you   ’ll   have   a   <br> </br>
   solid   understanding   of   Vue   ’s   fundamentals   and   will   be   able   to   build   a   wide   array   of   rich   ,   interactive   web   apps   with   the   framework   .   But   beyond   Vue   ’s   core   ,   <br> </br>
   there   are   tools   and   libraries   that   exist   in   the   Vue   ecosystem   that   ’s   often   needed   to   build   real-world   production   scale   applications   .   Things   like   <br> </br>
   client-side   routing   between   pages   ,   managing   complex   state   ,   and   heavy   API   interaction   at   scale   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   book   can   be   broken   down   into   two   parts   .   In   Part   I   ,   we   cover   all   the   fundamentals   with   a   progressive   ,   example-driven   approach   .   You   ’ll   first   introduce   <br> </br>
   Vue   through   a   Content  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Delivery </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Network </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   CDN   ) </span>  before   moving   towards   building   within   Webpack   bundled   applications   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   You   ’ll   gain   a   grasp   of   handling   user   interaction   ,   working   with   single-file   components   ,   understanding   simple   state   management   ,   and   how   custom   events   <br> </br>
   work   .   We   bookend   the   first   part   by   introducing   Vuex   and   how   Vuex   is   integrated   to   manage   overall   application   data   architecture   .   Part   II   of   this   book   moves   <br> </br>
   into   more   advanced   concepts   that   you   ’ll   often   see   used   in   large   ,   production   applications   .   We   ’ll   integrate   Vuex   to   a   server-persisted   app   ,   manage   rich   <br> </br>
   forms   ,   build   a   multi-page   app   that   uses   client-side   routing   ,   and   finally   explore   how   unit   tests   can   be   written   with   Vue   ’s   official   unit   testing   library   .   <br> </br>
   First   ,   know   that   you   do   not   need   to   read   this   book   linearly   from   cover-to-cover   .   However   ,   we   ’ve   ordered   the   contents   of   the   book   in   a   way   we   feel   fits   the   <br> </br>
   order   you   should   learn   the   concepts   .   Some   sections   in   Part   II   assume   you   ’ve   acquired   certain   fundamental   concepts   from   Part   I.   As   a   result   ,   we   encourage   <br> </br>
   you   to   learn   all   the   concepts   in   Part   I   of   the   book   first   before   diving   into   concepts   in   Part   II   .   Second   ,   keep   in   mind   this   package   is   more   than   just   a   book   -   it   ’s   <br> </br>
   a   course   complete   with   example   code   for   every   chapter   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Below   ,   we   ’ll   tell   you   :   how   to   approach   the   code   examples   and   how   to   get   help   if   something   goes   wrong   How   to   Get   the   Most   Out   of   This   Book   2   Vue   2.x   In   Sept.   20163   ,   <br> </br>
   the   Vue   framework   was   rewritten   and   released   as   version   2.0   .   Vue   2.0   introduced   new   concepts   such   as   the   Virual   DOM   ,   render   functions   ,   and   server-side   <br> </br>
   rendering   capabilities   .   In   addition   ,   version   2.0   was   rewritten   to   provide   significant   performance   improvements   over   v1   .   This   book   covers   ,   and   will   <br> </br>
   always   cover   ,   the   latest   release   of   Vue   -   which   is   currently   labelled   as   version   2.x   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Running   Code   Examples   This   book   comes   with   a   library   of   runnable   code   examples   .   The   code   is   available   to   download   from   the   same   place   where   you   purchased   <br> </br>
   this   book   .   If   you   have   any   trouble   finding   or   downloading   the   code   examples   ,   email   us   at   vuefullstack.io   .   Webpack   projects   For   Webpack-bundled   projects   <br> </br>
   ,   we   use   the   program   npm4   to   run   examples   .   You   can   install   the   application   dependencies   with   :   npm   install   And   boot   apps   with   one   of   the   following   commands   :   <br> </br>
   npm   run   start   or   npm   run   serve   With   every   chapter   ,   we   ’ll   reiterate   the   commands   necessary   to   install   application   dependancies   and   boot   example   code   .   <br> </br>
   After   running   npm   run   start   or   npm   run   serve   ,   you   will   see   some   output   on   your   screen   that   will   tell   you   what   URL   to   open   to   view   your   app   .   If   you   ’re   unfamiliar   <br> </br>
   with   npm   ,   we   cover   how   to   get   it   installed   in   the   “   Setting   Up   ”   section   in   the   second   chapter   .   If   you   ’re   ever   unclear   on   how   to   run   a   particular   sample   app   ,   <br> </br>
   checkout   the   README.md   in   that   project   ’s   directory   .   EveryWebpack   bundled   sample   project   contains   a   README.md   that   will   give   you   the   instructions   you   <br> </br>
   need   to   run   each   app   .   <br> </br>

   Since   the   Vue   library   is   hosted   externally   in   these   cases   ,   these   examples   will   require   your   machine   to   be   connected   to   the   internet   .   Code   Blocks   and   <br> </br>
   Context   The   majority   of   code   blocks   in   this   book   is   pulled   from   a   runnable   code   example   which   you   can   find   in   the   sample   code   .   For   example   ,   here   is   a   code   block   <br> </br>
   pulled   from   the   first   chapter   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   new   Vue  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   el   :   app   ,   data   :   submissions   :   Seed.submissions   ,   computed   :   sortedSubmissions   (   )   return </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> this.submissions.sort((a   ,   b   )   return   b.votes   -   a.votes   )   ;   ,   components   :   submission-component   :   submissionComponent   ) </span>  ;   Notice   that   the   header   of   this   <br> </br>
   code   block   states   the   path   to   the   file   which   contains   this   code   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Certain   code   examples   will   resemble   building   blocks   to   get   to   a   certain   point   and   thus   may   not   reflect   a   code   block   directly   from   the   sample   code   .   If   you   ever   <br> </br>
   feel   like   you   ’re   missing   the   context   for   a   code   example   ,   open   up   the   full   code   file   using   your   favorite   text   editor   .   This   book   is   written   with   the   <br> </br>
   expectation   that   you   ’ll   also   be   looking   at   the   example   code   alongside   the   manuscript   .   For   example   ,   we   often   need   to   import   libraries   to   get   our   code   to   run   .   <br> </br>
   In   the   early   chapters   of   the   book   we   show   these   import   statements   ,   because   it   ’s   not   clear   where   the   libraries   are   coming   from   How   to   Get   the   Most   Out   of   This   <br> </br>
   Book   4   otherwise   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   ,   the   later   chapters   of   the   book   aremore   advanced   and   they   focus   on   key   concepts   instead   of   repeating   boilerplate   code   that   was   covered   earlier   in   <br> </br>
   the   book   .   If   at   any   point   you   ’re   not   clear   on   the   context   ,   open   up   the   code   example   on   disk   .   Code   Block   Numbering   In   this   book   ,   we   mostly   build   larger   examples   <br> </br>
   in   steps   .   If   you   see   a   file   being   loaded   that   has   a   numeric   suffix   ,   that   generally   means   we   ’re   building   up   to   something   bigger   .   For   instance   ,   the   code   block   <br> </br>
   above   has   the   file   path   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   you   see   the   -N.js   syntax   ,   that   means   we   ’re   building   up   to   a   final   version   of   the   file   .   You   can   jump   into   that   file   and   see   the   state   of   all   the   code   at   that   <br> </br>
   particular   stage   .   Instruction   for   Windows   users   All   the   code   in   this   book   has   been   tested   on   a   Windows   machine   .   If   you   have   any   issues   running   the   code   on   <br> </br>
   Windows   ,   send   us   an   email5   and   we   ’ll   try   to   help   you   get   it   resolved   .   Ensure   Node.js   and   npm   are   installed   If   you   ’re   on   a   Windows   machine   and   have   yet   to   do   any   <br> </br>
   web   development   on   it   ,   you   can   install   the   Node.js   Windows   Installer   from   the   Node.js6   website   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   We   want   to   make   sure   that   the   book   is   both   accurate   and   clear   .   Similarly   ,   if   you   ’ve   found   a   bug   in   our   code   we   definitely   want   to   hear   about   it   .   If   you   ’re   having   <br> </br>
   trouble   getting  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> your   own   app   working   (   and   it   is   n’t   our   example   code   ) </span>  ,   this   case   is   a   bit   harder   for   us   to   handle   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   you   ’re   still   stuck   ,   we   ’d   still   love   to   hear   from   you   .   Emailing   Us   If   you   ’re   emailing   us   asking   for   technical   help   ,   here   ’s   what   we   ’d   like   to   know   :   What   <br> </br>

   actually   happened   ?   (   Including   relevant   log   output   .   )   The   absolute   best   way   to   get   technical   support   is   to   send   us   a   short   ,   self-contained   example   of   the   <br> </br>
   problem   .   Our   preferred   way   to   receive   this   would   be   for   you   to   send   us   a   Plunkr   link   by   using   this   URL8   as   a   template   .   That   URL   contains   a   runnable   ,   <br> </br>

   We   ’ll   take   a   deeper   look   into   installing   all   the   necessary   libraries   for   our   development   environment   in   the   next   chapter   .   Browser   We   highly   recommend   <br> </br>
   using   the   Google   Chrome   Web   Browser15   to   develop   Vue   apps   since   we   ’ll   be   using   the   Chrome   developer   toolkit16   throughout   this   book   .   To   follow   along   with   <br> </br>
   our   development   and   debugging   ,   we   recommend   installing   Chrome   ,   if   not   installed   already   .   With   Chrome   ,   Vue   provides   an   incredibly   useful   extension   ,   <br> </br>
   Vue.js   devtools17   that   simplifies   debugging   of   Vue   applications   .   We   ’ll   be   using   the   devtools   at   separate   points   throughout   the   book   so   we   encourage   you   <br> </br>
   to   install   it   as   well   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Note   :   With   certain   chapters   in   this   book   (   like   this   chapter   for   example   )   ,   we   ’ll   be   working   with   applications   opened   via   file   :   protocol   .   To   make   the   Vue   <br> </br>
   devtools   work   for   these   pages   ,   you   ’ll   need   to   check   “   Allow   access   to   file   URLs   ”   for   the   extension   in   Chrome   ’s   extension   manager   :   Allow   access   to   file   URLs   I   <br> </br>
   -   Your   first   Vue.js   Web   Application   8   JavaScript   ES6ES7   JavaScript   is   the   language   of   the   web   .   It   runs   on   many   different   browsers   ,   including   Google   Chrome   <br> </br>
   ,   Firefox   ,   Safari   ,   Microsoft   Edge   ,   and   Internet   Explorer   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Different   browsers   have   different   JavaScript   interpreters   which   execute   JavaScript   code   .   Its   widespread   adoption   as   the   Internet   ’s   client-side   <br> </br>
   scripting   language   led   to   the   formation   of   a   standards   body   which   manages   its   specification   .   The   specification   is   called   ECMAScript   or   ES   .   The   5th   <br> </br>
   edition   of   the   specification   is   called   ES5   .   We   think   of   ES5   as   a   “   version   ”   of   the   JavaScript   programming   language   .   Finalized   in   2009   ,   ES5   was   adopted   by   all   <br> </br>
   major   browsers   within   a   few   years   .   The   6th   edition   of   JavaScript   is   referred   to   as   ES6   .   Finalized   in   2015   ,   the   latest   versions   of   major   browsers   are   still   <br> </br>
   finishing   adding   support   for   ES6   as   of   2017   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ES6   provides   a   significant   update   .   It   contains   a   whole   host   of   new   features   for   JavaScript   ,   almost   two   dozen   in   total   .   JavaScript   written   in   ES6   is   <br> </br>
   tangibly   different   than   JavaScript   written   in   ES5   .   ES7   ,   a   much   smaller   update   that   builds   on   ES6   ,   was   ratified   in   June   2016   .   ES7   contains   only   two   new   <br> </br>
   features   .   To   take   advantage   of   the   future   versions   of   JavaScript   ,   we   want   to   write   our   code   in   ES6ES7   today   .   We   ’ll   also   want   our   JavaScript   to   run   on   older   <br> </br>
   browsers   until   they   fade   out   of   widespread   use   .   This   book   is   written   using   the   JavaScript   ES7   version   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   ES6   ratified   a   majority   of   these   new   features   ,   we   ’ll   commonly   refer   to   these   new   features   as   ES6   features   .   ES6   is   sometimes   referred   to   as   ES2015   ,   the   <br> </br>
   year   of   its   finalization   .   ES7   ,   in   turn   ,   is   often   referred   to   as   ES2016   .   Getting   started   Sample   Code   All   the   code   examplessnippets   contained   in  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> this </span>  <br> </br>
