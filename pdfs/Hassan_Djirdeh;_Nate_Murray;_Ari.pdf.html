   examples   ,   we   ’ve   resorted   to   directly   including   the   Vue   library   from   a   Content   Delivery   Network   (   CDN   )   to   get   the   app   up   and   running   as   fast   as   possible   .   In   <br> </br>
   this   book   ,   applications   that   introduce   Vue   from   a   CDN   often   consist   of   a   single   HTML   file   (   index.html   )   for   markup   and   a   single   JS   file   (   main.js   )   for   all   Vue   <br> </br>
   code   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   With   these   examples   ,   we   ’ll   be   able   to   run   the   app   by   opening   the   index.html   file   in   our   browser   (   e.g.   right   click   index.html   file   and   select   Open   With   Google   <br> </br>
   Chrome   )   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Since   the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Vue   library </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   hosted   externally   in   these   cases   ,   these   examples   will   require   your   machine   to   be   connected   to   the   internet </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Code   Blocks   and   Context   The   majority   of   code   blocks   in   this   book   is   pulled   from   a   runnable   code   example   which   you   can   find   in   the   sample   code   .   For   example   ,   <br> </br>
   here   is   a   code   block   pulled   from   the   first   chapter   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   new   Vue   (   el   :   app   ,   data   :   submissions   :   Seed.submissions   ,   computed   :   <br> </br>
   sortedSubmissions   (   )   return   this.submissions.sort((a   ,   b   )   return   b.votes   -   a.votes   )   ;   ,   components   :   submission-component   :   submissionComponent   )   ;   <br> </br>
   Notice   that   the   header   of   this   code   block   states   the   path   to   the   file   which   contains   this   code   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Certain   code   examples   will   resemble   building   blocks   to   get   to   a   certain   point   and   thus   may   not   reflect   a   code   block   directly   from   the   sample   code   .   If   you   ever   <br> </br>
   feel   like   you   ’re   missing   the   context   for   a   code   example   ,   open   up   the   full   code   file   using   your   favorite   text   editor   .   This   book   is   written   with   the   <br> </br>
   expectation   that   you   ’ll   also   be   looking   at   the   example   code   alongside   the   manuscript   .   For   example   ,   we   often   need   to   import   libraries   to   get   our   code   to   run   .   <br> </br>
   In   the   early   chapters   of   the   book   we   show   these   import   statements   ,   because   it   ’s   not   clear   where   the   libraries   are   coming   from   How   to   Get   the   Most   Out   of   This   <br> </br>
   Book   4   otherwise   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   ,   the   later   chapters   of   the   book   aremore   advanced   and   they   focus   on   key   concepts   instead   of   repeating   boilerplate   code   that   was   covered   earlier   in   <br> </br>
   the   book   .   If   at   any   point   you   ’re   not   clear   on   the   context   ,   open   up   the   code   example   on   disk   .   Code   Block   Numbering   In   this   book   ,   we   mostly   build   larger   examples   <br> </br>
   in   steps   .   If   you   see   a   file   being   loaded   that   has   a   numeric   suffix   ,   that   generally   means   we   ’re   building   up   to   something   bigger   .   For   instance   ,   the   code   block   <br> </br>
   above   has   the   file   path   :   upvoteapp_5main.js   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> When   you   see   the   -N.js   syntax   ,   that   means   we   ’re   building   up   to   a   final   version   of   the   file   .   You   can   jump   into   that   file   and   see   the   state   of   all   the   code   at   that </span>  <br> </br>

   Sublime   )   .   By   opening   the   upvote   folder   ,   we   ’ll   see   all   the   sub-directories   containedwithin   the   sample   app   :   upvote   app   app_1   app_2   app_3   app_4   app_5   <br> </br>
