   the   ways   of   thinking   and   talking   about   thinking   and   talking   presented   here   arise   naturally   out   of   a   reading   of   the   philosophical   tradition   (   above   all   Kant   <br> </br>

Preface   xxv   Toward   a   Normative   Pragmatics   We   is   said   in   many   ways   .   We   may   be   thee   and   me   .   We   may   be   all   that   talks   or   all   that   <br> </br>
   moves   ,   all   that   minds   or   all   that   matters   .   Since   these   boundaries   are   elastic   ,   we   have   a   task   of   demarcation   :   telling   who   or   what   we   are   ,   distinguishing   <br> </br>
   ourselves   from   the   other   sorts   of   objects   or   organisms   we   find   in   our   world   .   Saying   who   we   are   can   contract   to   an   empty   exercise   in   self-congratulation-a   <br> </br>
   ritual   rehearsal   of   the   endless   ,   pitiable   disabilities   of   clockworks   ,   carrots   ,   cows   ,   and   the   clan   across   the   river   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Such   a   mean-spirited   version   of   the   demarcational   enterprise   is   not   forced   on   us   by   the   way   things   are   ,   however   .   For   what   we   are   is   made   as   much   as   found   ,   <br> </br>
   decided   as   well   as   discovered   .   The   sort   of   thing   we   are   depends   ,   in   part   ,   on   what   we   take   ourselves   to   be   .   One   characteristic   way   we   develop   and   make   <br> </br>
   ourselves   into   what   we   are   is   by   expressing   ,   exploring   ,   and   clarifying   our   understanding   of   what   we   are   .   Arbitrary   distinctions   of   biology   ,   geography   ,   <br> </br>
   culture   ,   or   preference   can   be   and   have   been   seized   on   to   enforce   and   make   intelligible   the   crucial   distinction   between   us   and   them   (   or   it   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> philosophical </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> thought   is   coeval   with   the   impulse   to   understand   ourselves   according   to   a   more   principled   ,   less   parochial   story-and   so   to   be   a   more </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> principled   ,   less   parochial   sort   of   being </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   reflexive   character   of   the   proposal   that   we   use   self-demarcation   as   the   criterion   by   which   we   demarcate   ourselves   does   not   suffice   to   render   it   purely   <br> </br>
   formal   ,   however   .   It   does   not   save   us   the   trouble   of   contentful   self-understanding   .   For   until   it   has   been   specified   in   other   terms   what   one   must   be   able   to   do   <br> </br>
   in   order   to   count   as   saying   we   ,   demarcation   by   appeal   to   such   attitudes   remains   an   aspiration   tacked   to   a   slogan-empty   ,   waiting   for   us   to   fill   it   .   We-saying   <br> </br>
   of   the   sort   that   might   be   of   demarcational   interest   is   not   a   matter   merely   of   the   production   of   certain   vocables-indeed   perhaps   the   relevant   kind   of   <br> </br>
   attitude   is   not   a   linguistic   matter   at   all   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Nor   again   does   it   consist   simply   in   the   engendering   of   warm   mammalian   fellow-feeling   .   Making   explicit   to   ourselves   who   we   are   requires   a   theoretical   <br> </br>
   account   of   what   it   is   in   practice   to   treat   another   as   one   of   us   .   What   is   it   we   do   that   is   so   special   ?   The   answer   to   be   explored   here-a   traditional   one   ,   to   be   <br> </br>
   sure-is   that   we   are   distinguished   by   capacities   that   are   broadly   cognitive   .   Our   transactions   with   other   things   ,   and   with   each   other   ,   in   a   special   and   <br> </br>
   characteristic   sense   mean   something   to   us   ,   they   have   a   conceptual   content   for   us   ,   we   understand   them   in   one   way   rather   than   another   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   this   demarcational   strategy   that   underlies   the   classical   iden-   tification   of   us   as   reasonable   beings   .   Reason   is   as   nothing   to   the   beasts   of   the   field   <br> </br>
   .   We   are   the   ones   on   whom   reasons   are   binding   ,   who   are   subject   to   the   peculiar   force   of   the   better   reason   .   This   force   is   a   species   of   normative   force   ,   a   <br> </br>
   rational   ought   .   Being   rational   is   being   bound   or   constrained   by   these   norms   ,   being   subject   to   the   authority   of   reasons   .   Saying   we   in   this   sense   is   placing   <br> </br>
   ourselves   and   each   other   in   the   space   of   reasons   ,   by   giving   and   asking   for   reasons   for   our   attitudes   and   performances   .   <br> </br>

   Our   attitudes   and   acts   exhibit   an   intelligible   content   ,   a   content   that   can   be   grasped   or   understood   ,   by   being   caught   up   in   a   web   of   reasons   ,   by   being   <br> </br>
   inferentially   articulated   .   Understanding   in   this   favored   sense   is   a   grasp   of   reasons   ,   mastery   of   proprieties   of   theoretical   and   practical   inference   .   <br> </br>

   uptake   .   Kant   understands   concepts   as   having   the   form   of   rules   ,   which   is   to   say   that   they   specify   how   something   ought   (   according   to   the   rule   )   to   be   done   .   l   2   .   <br> </br>

   Although   our   actions   and   4   .   Wittgenstein   on   tbe   Normative   Significance   of   Intentional   Content   In   fact   ,   by   contrast   ,   The   laws   of   inference   can   be   said   to   <br> </br>
   compel   us   ;   in   the   same   sense   ,   that   is   to   say   ,   as   other   laws   in   human   society.,,14   They   determine   ,   in   a   sense   yet   to   be   specified   ,   what   one   ought   to   do   .   Being   <br> </br>
   compelled   in   this   sense   is   entirely   compatible   with   failing   to   act   as   one   must   .   Indeed   ,   the   physical   or   causal   possibility   of   making   a   mistake   ,   or   doing   <br> </br>
   what   one   is   obliged   ,   by   what   one   means   ,   intends   ,   believes   ,   and   desires   ,   not   to   do   ,   is   essential   to   the   conception   of   such   states   and   shows   the   essentially   <br> </br>
   normative   nature   of   their   significance   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   I   do   nt   mean   that   what   I   do   now   (   in   grasping   a   sense   )   determines   the   future   use   causally   and   as   a   matter   of   experience   ,   but   that   in   a   queer   way   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> use   itself </span>  <br> </br>

   way   answerable   for   its   correctness   to   what   is   represented   ,   what   it   is   about   .   I   ?   Thus   the   claim   that   semantically   1   .   Regulism   :   Norms   as   Explicit   Rules   or   <br> </br>

   bindingness   of   underlying   principles   ,   may   be   called   regulism   about   norms.20   2   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Wittgensteins   Regress   Argument   This   was   our   paradox   :   no   course   of   action   could   be   determined   by   a   rule   ,   because   every   course   of   action   can   be   made   out   to   <br> </br>
   accord   with   the   rule   .   The   answer   was   :   if   everything   can   be   made   out   to   accord   with   the   rule   ,   then   it   can   also   be   made   out   to   conflict   with   it   .   And   so   there   would   <br> </br>
   be   neither   accord   nor   conflict   here   .   It   can   be   seen   that   there   is   a   misunderstanding   here   from   the   mere   fact   that   in   the   course   of   our   argument   we   give   one   <br> </br>
   interpretation   after   another   ;   as   if   each   one   contented   us   for   at   least   a   moment   ,   until   we   thought   of   yet   another   standing   behind   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   What   this   shows   is   that   there   is   a   way   of   grasping   a   rule   [   eine   Auffassung   einer   Regel   ]   which   is   not   an   interpretation   ,   but   which   is   exhibited   in   what   we   call   <br> </br>
   obeying   the   rule   and   going   against   it   in   actual   cases.24   Absent   such   a   practical   way   of   grasping   norms   ,   no   sense   can   be   made   of   the   distinction   between   <br> </br>
   correct   and   incorrect   performance-of   the   difference   between   acting   according   to   the   norm   and   acting   against   it   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Norms </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> would   then   be   unintelligible </span>  .   <br> </br>

   contrast   to   the   denizens   of   the   realm   of   nature   ,   is   that   natural   beings   ,   who   merely   act   according   to   rules   ,   that   is   ,   regularly   ,   are   capable   of   <br> </br>
