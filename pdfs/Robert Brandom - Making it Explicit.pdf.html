Two   Concepts   of   Concepts   614   Abbreviations   653   Notes   655   Index   717   Preface  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> We   work   in   the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> dark-we </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> do   what   we   can-we   give   what   we   have </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Our </span>  <br> </br>

The   rest   is   the   madness   of   art   .   That   old   philosopher   Fred   Allen   used   to   say   he   could   not   understand   why   <br> </br>
   someone   would   spend   years   writing   a   novel   ,   when   for   a   few   dollars   you   could   buy   one   practically   anywhere   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> similar   remark </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> might   be   made   about   contributions   to   that   peculiar   genre   of   creative   nonfiction   writing   to   which   philosophical   works   such   as   this   one </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> belong </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> This </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> book   is   an   investigation   into   the   nature   of   language   :   of   the   social   practices   that   distinguish   us   as   rational   ,   indeed   logical   ,   concept-mongering </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> creatures-knowers   and   agents </span>  .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> This </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   of   course   a   topic   that   has   been   much   explored   by   philosophers   ,   both   the   mighty   dead   and   the   ablest   contemporary </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> thinkers </span>  .   Surrounded   as   we   are   by   the   riches   they   have   bequeathed   ,   it   is   hard   to   avoid   asking   why   one   should   bother   reading-let   alone   writing-yet   another   <br> </br>
   such   work   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   question   may   seem   all   the   more   urgent   inasmuch   as   it   is   acknowledged   (   indeed   ,   some   pains   are   taken   to   show   )   that   the   basic   building   blocks   out   of   which   <br> </br>
   this   account   is   constructed-its   motivating   insights   ,   commitments   ,   and   strategies-are   not   novel   or   original   .   Still   ,   though   the   ways   of   thinking   and   <br> </br>
   talking   about   thinking   and   talking   presented   here   arise   naturally   out   of   a   reading   of   the   philosophical   tradition   (   above   all   Kant   ,   Frege   ,   and   <br> </br>
   Wittgenstein   )   and   of   its   development   by   more   recent   thinkers   ,   both   that   tradition   and   its   significance   for   us   today   are   by   current   standards   seen   <br> </br>
   decidedly   on   a   slant   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   a   result   ,   the   story   told   in   these   pages   comes   at   familiar   things   from   an   unfamiliar   direction   .   Its   promise   lies   xii   Preface   in   the   sort   of   added   depth   and   <br> </br>
   dimension   that   only   binocular   vision   affords   that   is   the   point   of   laying   a   substantially   different   conceptual   perspective   alongside   our   more   <br> </br>
   accustomed   line   of   sight   .   In   keeping   with   this   understanding   of   the   sort   of   payoff   that   can   be   hoped   for   ,   the   body   of   the   work   aims   to   set   criteria   of   adequacy   <br> </br>
   for   a   theory   of   discursive   practice   ,   motivate   the   approach   adopted   ,   work   the   model   out   in   detail   ,   and   apply   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   idea   is   to   show   what   kind   of   understanding   and   explanatory   power   one   gets   from   talking   this   way   ,   rather   than   to   argue   that   one   is   somehow   rationally   <br> </br>
   obliged   to   talk   this   way   .   Of   course   I   take   it   that   the   claims   made   in   what   follows   are   true   I   endorse   those   assertions   they   express   my   commitments   .   One   of   the   <br> </br>
   central   tenets   of   the   account   of   linguistic   practice   put   forward   here   is   that   the   characteristic   authority   on   which   the   role   of   assertions   in   <br> </br>
   communication   depends   is   intelligible   only   against   the   background   of   a   correlative   responsibility   to   vindicate   ones   entitlement   to   the   commitments   <br> </br>
   such   speech   acts   express   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   possible   to   secure   entitlement   to   the   commitments   (   assertional   ,   inferential   ,   and   referential   )   implicit   in   an   idiom   without   gainsaying   the   <br> </br>
   possibility   of   entitlement   to   a   different   one   .   But   even   such   a   modest   justificatory   project   is   of   interest   only   to   someone   who   both   understands   the   <br> </br>
   commitments   in   question   and   has   some   reason   to   want   to   become   entitled   to   talk   in   ways   that   presuppose   them   .   Both   of   these   ends   are   served   by   starting   the   <br> </br>
   story   with   some   historical   lessons   .   Accordingly   ,   Chapters   1   and   2   form   an   entrance   hall   to   the   rest   of   the   edifice   ,   one   whose   main   architectural   features   <br> </br>
   are   made   more   noticeable   by   the   judicious   placement   of   ancestor   portraits   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   same   figure   appears   on   many   walls   ,   almost   always   recognizable   ,   but   often   portrayed   from   unusual   vantage   points   (   from   behind   ,   from   above   )   or   <br> </br>
   highlighting   something   other   than   the   familiar   face   .   In   particular   ,   the   portrait   of   Frege   will   seem   to   some   to   be   like   one   of   those   odd   photographs   of   a   <br> </br>
   reclining   figure   taken   with   the   lens   so   close   that   the   subjects   left   foot   assumes   gigantic   proportions   ,   dwarfing   the   rest   of   the   individual   ,   whose   head   <br> </br>
   and   torso   dwindle   to   the   dimensions   of   insignificant   appendages   .   Nonetheless   ,   the   tradition   that   is   retrospectively   constituted   by   the   unusual   <br> </br>
   emphases   and   filiations   to   be   found   here   is   meant   to   be   coherent   and   compelling   in   its   own   terms   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   not   just   whatever   rewriting   of   the   history   of   philosophy   happens   to   be   needed   to   make   the   waning   years   of   the   twentieth   century   safe   for   the   views   I   put   <br> </br>
   forward   .   Rather   ,   those   views   have   the   shape   they   do   because   of   this   reading   of   now   we   got   to   where   we   are   .   One   of   the   overarching   methodological   commitments   <br> </br>
   that   orients   this   project   is   to   explain   the   meanings   of   linguistic   expressions   in   terms   of   their   use-an   endorsement   of   one   dimension   of   Wittgensteins   <br> </br>
   pragmatism   .   For   although   he   drove   home   the   importance   of   such   an   approach   ,   other   features   of   his   thought-in   particular   his   theoretical   quietism-have   <br> </br>
   discouraged   his   admirers   from   attempting   to   work   out   the   details   of   a   theory   of   meaning   or   ,   Preface   xiii   for   that   matter   ,   of   use   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   result   has   been   a   substantial   disjunction   between   semantic   theorizing   (   about   the   sorts   of   contents   expressed   by   various   locutions   )   ,   on   the   one   hand   ,   <br> </br>
   and   pragmatic   theorizing   (   about   the   linguistic   practices   in   which   those   locutions   are   employed   )   ,   on   the   other   .   The   explanatory   strategy   pursued   here   is   <br> </br>
   to   begin   with   an   account   of   social   practices   ,   identify   the   particular   structure   they   must   exhibit   in   order   to   qualify   as   specifically   linguistic   <br> </br>
   practices   ,   and   then   consider   what   different   sorts   of   semantic   contents   those   practices   can   confer   on   states   ,   performances   ,   and   expressions   caught   up   in   <br> </br>
   them   in   suitable   ways   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> result </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   a   new   kind   of   conceptualrole   semantics   .   It   is   at   once   firmly   rooted   in   actual   practices   of   producing   and   consuming   speech   acts   ,   and </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> sufficiently   finely   articulated   to   make   clear   how   those   practices   are   capable   of   conferring   the   rich   variety   of   kinds   of   content   that   philosophers   of </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> language   have   revealed   and   reveled   in </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Claims   about   the   relations   between   meaning   and   use   have   a   clear   sense   only   in   the   context   of   a   specification   of   the   vocabulary   in   which   that   use   is   described   <br> </br>
   or   ascribed   .   At   one   extreme   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> use </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> clearly   determines   meaning   in   the   strongest   possible   sense   if   admissible   specifications   of   the   use   can   include   such </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   At   an   opposite   extreme   ,   if   admissible   specifications   of   use   are   restricted   to   descriptions   of   the   movements   of   particles   expressed   in   the   vocabulary   of   <br> </br>
   physics   ,   not   only   will   the   use   ,   so   described   ,   fail   to   settle   what   is   meant   or   expressed   by   various   noises   or   inscriptions   ,   it   will   fail   to   settle   even   that   <br> </br>
   anything   is   meant   or   expressed   by   them   .   The   specification   of   use   employed   here   is   neither   so   generous   as   to   permit   semantic   or   intentional   vocabulary   nor   <br> </br>
   so   parsimonious   as   to   insist   on   purely   naturalistic   vocabulary   .   Instead   ,   it   makes   essential   use   of   normative   vocabulary   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   practices   that   confer   propositional   and   other   sorts   of   conceptual   content   implicitly   contain   norms   concerning   how   it   is   correct   to   use   expressions   ,   <br> </br>
   under   what   circumstances   it   is   appropriate   to   perform   various   speech   acts   ,   and   what   the   appropriate   consequences   of   such   performances   are   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Chapter   1 </span>  <br> </br>

   affect   the   commitments   (   and   entitlements   to   those   commitments   )   acknowledged   or   otherwise   acquired   by   those   whose   performances   they   are   .   <br> </br>

   This   is   an   explication   of   explicitly   normative   conceptual   contents   in   terms   of   implicitly   normative   practices   ,   rather   than   a   reduction   of   normative   <br> </br>
   terms   to   nonnormative   ones   .   It   illuminates   the   normative   dimension   of   discursive   practice   in   line   with   the   methodological   principle   that   implicit   <br> </br>
   structures   are   often   best   understood   by   looking   at   how   they   can   be   made   explicit   .   The   first   step   in   the   project   is   accordingly   the   elaboration   of   a   <br> </br>
   pragmatics   (   a   theory   of   the   use   of   language   )   that   is   couched   in   terms   of   practical   scorekeeping   attitudes   of   attributing   and   acknowledging   deontic   <br> </br>

   The   pragmatic   significance   of   performanceseventually   ,   speech   acts   such   as   assertions-is   then   understood   to   consist   in   the   difference   those   <br> </br>
   performances   make   to   the   commitments   and   entitlements   attributed   by   various   scorekeepers   .   The   next   step   is   to   say   what   structure   such   a   set   of   social   <br> </br>
   practices   must   have   in   order   to   qualify   as   specifically   discursive   practice   .   This   is   a   matter   of   moving   from   pragmatics   to   semantics   .   The   defining   <br> </br>
   characteristic   of   discursive   practice   is   the   production   and   consumption   of   specifically   propositional   contents   .   It   is   argued   in   Chapter   2   that   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   The   propositional   contentfulness   of   beliefs   ,   no   less   than   of   claims   ,   should   be   understood   in   terms   of   their   role   in   reasoning   of   various   kinds   .   The   <br> </br>
   inferentially   articulated   commitments   expressed   by   assertional   speech   acts   are   doxastic   commitments   .   Much   of   the   theoretical   work   done   by   the   concept   <br> </br>
   of   belief   can   be   done   instead   by   appeal   to   this   sort   of   deontic   status   ,   and   to   the   practical   scorekeeping   attitudes   of   acknowledging   or   undertaking   such   <br> </br>
   commitments   .   A   social   ,   linguistic   account   of   intentionality   is   accordingly   elaborated   in   Chapter   3   .   It   is   extended   in   Chapter   4   to   incorporate   <br> </br>
   treatments   of   perception   and   action   and   of   the   contribution   those   phenomena   make   to   the   empirical   and   practical   dimensions   of   the   propositional   <br> </br>
   contents   of   the   states   ,   acts   ,   and   attitudes   involved   in   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   not   denied   that   it   makes   sense   to   talk   about   nonlinguistic   creatures   as   having   intentional   states   ,   but   it   is   claimed   that   our   understanding   of   such   <br> </br>
   talk   is   parasitic   on   our   understanding   of   the   sort   of   full-blooded   linguistic   intentionality   characteristic   of   states   and   attitudes   that   only   beings   <br> </br>
   who   engage   in   discursive   social   practices   can   have   .   This   story   amounts   ,   then   ,   to   an   account   of   the   relations   of   mindedness-in   the   sense   of   sapience   rather   <br> </br>
   than   mere   sentience-to   behavior   .   As   in   the   parallel   case   of   meaning   and   use   ,   the   clarification   of   these   relations   must   begin   with   a   determination   of   what   <br> </br>
   vocabulary   it   is   admissible   to   use   in   specifying   the   relevant   behavior   again   there   is   a   spectrum   of   possibilities   ,   from   allowing   intentional   vocabulary   <br> </br>
   with   semantic   locutions   ,   such   as   I   acting   as   if   one   believed   that   snow   is   white   ,   ranging   down   to   restrictions   to   physicalistic   or   other   naturalistic   <br> </br>
