   Conclusion   614   I.   Two   Concepts   of   Concepts   614   Abbreviations   653   Notes   655   Index   717   Preface   We   work   in   the   dark-we   do   what   we   can-we   give   what   we   have   .   Our   <br> </br>
   doubt   is   our   passion   and   our   passion   is   our   task   .   The   rest   is   the   madness   of   art   .   That   old   philosopher   Fred   Allen   used   to   say   he   could   not   understand   why   <br> </br>
   someone   would   spend   years   writing   a   novel   ,   when   for   a   few   dollars   you   could   buy   one   practically   anywhere   .   A   similar   remark   might   be   made   about   <br> </br>
   contributions   to   that   peculiar   genre   of   creative   nonfiction   writing   to   which   philosophical   works   such   as   this   one   belong   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   book   is   an   investigation   into   the   nature   of   language   :   of   the   social   practices   that   distinguish   us   as   rational   ,   indeed   logical   ,   concept-mongering   <br> </br>
   creatures-knowers   and   agents   .   This   is   of   course   a   topic   that   has   been   much   explored   by   philosophers   ,   both   the   mighty   dead   and   the   ablest   contemporary   <br> </br>
   thinkers   .   Surrounded   as   we   are   by   the   riches   they   have   bequeathed   ,   it   is   hard   to   avoid   asking   why   one   should   bother   reading-let   alone   writing-yet   another   <br> </br>
   such   work   .   This   question   may   seem   all   the   more   urgent   inasmuch   as   it   is   acknowledged   (   indeed   ,   some   pains   are   taken   to   show   )   that   the   basic   building   blocks   <br> </br>
   out   of   which   this   account   is   constructed-its   motivating   insights   ,   commitments   ,   and   strategies-are   not   novel   or   original   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Still   ,   though   the   ways   of   thinking   and   talking   about   thinking   and   talking   presented   here   arise   naturally   out   of   a   reading   of   the   philosophical   tradition  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> above   all   Kant   ,   Frege   ,   and   Wittgenstein   ) </span>  and   of   its   development   by   more   recent   thinkers   ,   both   that   tradition   and   its   significance   for   us   today   are   by   <br> </br>
   current   standards   seen   decidedly   on   a   slant   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   a   result   ,   the   story   told   in   these   pages   comes   at   familiar   things   from   an   unfamiliar   direction   .   Its   promise   lies   xii   Preface   in   the   sort   of   added   depth   and   <br> </br>
   dimension   that   only   binocular   vision   affords   that   is   the   point   of   laying   a   substantially   different   conceptual   perspective   alongside   our   more   <br> </br>
   accustomed   line   of   sight   .   In   keeping   with   this   understanding   of   the   sort   of   payoff   that   can   be   hoped   for   ,   the   body   of   the   work   aims   to   set   criteria   of   adequacy   <br> </br>
   for   a   theory   of   discursive   practice   ,   motivate   the   approach   adopted   ,   work   the   model   out   in   detail   ,   and   apply   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   idea   is   to   show   what   kind   of   understanding   and   explanatory   power   one   gets   from   talking   this   way   ,   rather   than   to   argue   that   one   is   somehow   rationally   <br> </br>
   obliged   to   talk   this   way   .   Of   course   I   take   it   that   the   claims   made   in   what   follows   are   true   I   endorse   those   assertions   they   express   my   commitments   .   One   of   the   <br> </br>
   central   tenets   of   the   account   of   linguistic   practice   put   forward   here   is   that   the   characteristic   authority   on   which   the   role   of   assertions   in   <br> </br>
   communication   depends   is   intelligible   only   against   the   background   of   a   correlative   responsibility   to   vindicate   ones   entitlement   to   the   commitments   <br> </br>
   such   speech   acts   express   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   possible   to   secure   entitlement   to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> commitments </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   assertional   ,   inferential   ,   and   referential   ) </span>  implicit   in   an   idiom   without   gainsaying   the   <br> </br>
   possibility   of   entitlement   to   a   different   one   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   even   such   a   modest   justificatory   project   is   of   interest   only   to   someone   who   both   understands   the   commitments   in   question   and   has   some   reason   to   want   to   <br> </br>
   become   entitled   to   talk   in   ways   that   presuppose   them   .   Both   of   these   ends   are   served   by   starting   the   story   with   some   historical   lessons   .   Accordingly   ,   <br> </br>
   Chapters   1   and   2   form   an   entrance   hall   to   the   rest   of   the   edifice   ,   one   whose   main   architectural   features   are   made   more   noticeable   by   the   judicious   placement   <br> </br>
   of   ancestor   portraits   .   The   same   figure   appears   on   many   walls   ,   almost   always   recognizable   ,   but   often   portrayed   from   unusual   vantage   points   (   from   behind   ,   <br> </br>
   from   above   )   or   highlighting   something   other   than   the   familiar   face   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   particular   ,   the   portrait   of   Frege   will   seem   to   some   to   be   like   one   of   those   odd   photographs   of   a   reclining   figure   taken   with   the   lens   so   close   that   the   <br> </br>
   subjects   left   foot   assumes   gigantic   proportions   ,   dwarfing   the   rest   of   the   individual   ,   whose   head   and   torso   dwindle   to   the   dimensions   of   insignificant   <br> </br>
   appendages   .   Nonetheless   ,   the   tradition   that   is   retrospectively   constituted   by   the   unusual   emphases   and   filiations   to   be   found   here   is   meant   to   be   <br> </br>
   coherent   and   compelling   in   its   own   terms   .   It   is   not   just   whatever   rewriting   of   the   history   of   philosophy   happens   to   be   needed   to   make   the   waning   years   of   the   <br> </br>
   twentieth   century   safe   for   the   views   I   put   forward   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Rather   ,   those   views   have   the   shape   they   do   because   of   this   reading   of   now   we   got   to   where   we   are   .   One   of   the   overarching   methodological   commitments   that   <br> </br>
   orients   this   project   is   to   explain   the   meanings   of   linguistic   expressions   in   terms   of   their   use-an   endorsement   of   one   dimension   of   Wittgensteins   <br> </br>
   pragmatism   .   For   although   he   drove   home   the   importance   of   such   an   approach   ,   other   features   of   his   thought-in   particular   his   theoretical   quietism-have   <br> </br>
   discouraged   his   admirers   from   attempting   to   work   out   the   details   of   a   theory   of   meaning   or   ,   Preface   xiii   for   that   matter   ,   of   use   .   <br> </br>

   ways   .   The   result   is   a   new   kind   of   conceptualrole   semantics   .   It   is   at   once   firmly   rooted   in   actual   practices   of   producing   and   consuming   speech   acts   ,   and   <br> </br>
   sufficiently   finely   articulated   to   make   clear   how   those   practices   are   capable   of   conferring   the   rich   variety   of   kinds   of   content   that   philosophers   of   <br> </br>
   language   have   revealed   and   reveled   in   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Claims   about   the   relations   between   meaning   and   use   have   a   clear   sense   only   in   the   context   of   a   specification   of   the   vocabulary   in   which   that   use   is   described   <br> </br>
   or   ascribed   .   At   one   extreme   ,   use   clearly   determines   meaning   in   the   strongest   possible   sense   if   admissible   specifications   of   the   use   can   include   such   <br> </br>
   phrases   as   using   the   word   not   to   express   negation   or   using   the   term   Julius   Caesar   to   refer   to   Julius   Caesar   .   At   an   opposite   extreme   ,   if   admissible   <br> </br>
   specifications   of   use   are   restricted   to   descriptions   of   the   movements   of   particles   expressed   in   the   vocabulary   of   physics   ,   not   only   will   the   use   ,   so   <br> </br>
   described   ,   fail   to   settle   what   is   meant   or   expressed   by   various   noises   or   inscriptions   ,   it   will   fail   to   settle   even   that   anything   is   meant   or   expressed   by   <br> </br>
   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   specification   of   use   employed   here   is   neither   so   generous   as   to   permit   semantic   or   intentional   vocabulary   nor   so   parsimonious   as   to   insist   on   purely   <br> </br>
   naturalistic   vocabulary   .   Instead   ,   it   makes   essential   use   of   normative   vocabulary   .   The   practices   that   confer   propositional   and   other   sorts   of   <br> </br>
   conceptual   content   implicitly   contain   norms   concerning   how   it   is   correct   to   use   expressions   ,   under   what   circumstances   it   is   appropriate   to   perform   <br> </br>
   various   speech   acts   ,   and   what   the   appropriate   consequences   of   such   performances   are   .   Chapter   1   introduces   and   motivates   this   normative   pragmatics   ,   <br> </br>
   which   is   rooted   in   considerations   advanced   by   Kant   ,   Frege   ,   and   Wittgenstein   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   No   attempt   is   made   to   eliminate   ,   in   favor   of   nonnormative   or   naturalistic   vocabulary   ,   the   normative   vocabulary   employed   in   specifying   the   practices   <br> </br>
   that   are   the   use   of   a   language   .   Interpreting   states   ,   performances   ,   and   expressions   as   semantically   or   intentionally   contentful   is   understood   as   <br> </br>
   attributing   to   their   occurrence   an   inelirninably   normative   pragmatic   significance   .   Though   this   normative   dimension   of   linguistic   practice   is   taken   <br> </br>
   to   be   ineliminable   ,   it   is   not   treated   as   primitive   or   inexplicable   .   It   is   rendered   less   mysterious   in   two   ways   .   First   ,   linguistic   norms   are   understood   as   <br> </br>
   instituted   by   social-practical   activity   .   The   pragmatic   significances   of   different   sorts   of   speech   acts   are   rendered   theoretically   in   terms   of   how   <br> </br>
   those   performances   xiv   Preface   affect  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> commitments </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   and   entitlements   to   those   commitments   ) </span>  acknowledged   or   otherwise   acquired   by   those   whose   <br> </br>
   performances   they   are   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   norms   implicit   in   linguistic   practice   are   accordingly   presented   in   a   specifically   deontic   form   .   But   these   deontic   statuses   are   understood   in   tum   as   a   <br> </br>
   form   of   social   status   ,   instituted   by   the   practical   attitudes   of   those   who   attribute   and   acknowledge   such   statuses   .   The   natural   world   does   not   come   with   <br> </br>
   commitments   and   entitlements   in   it   they   are   products   of   human   activity   .   In   particular   ,   they   are   creatures   of   the   attitudes   of   taking   ,   treating   ,   or   <br> </br>
   responding   to   someone   in   practice   as   committed   or   entitled   (   for   instance   ,   to   various   further   performances   )   .   Mastering   this   sort   of   norm-instituting   <br> </br>
   social   practice   is   a   kind   of   practical   know-how-a   matter   of   keeping   deontic   score   by   keeping   track   of   ones   own   and   others   commitments   and   entitlements   to   <br> </br>
   those   commitments   ,   and   altering   that   score   in   systematic   ways   based   on   the   performances   each   practitioner   produces   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   norms   that   govern   the   use   of   linguistic   expressions   are   implicit   in   these   deontic   scorekeeping   practices   .   The   second   way   norms   are   rendered   less   <br> </br>
   mysterious   is   by   explaining   exactly   what   is   expressed   by   normative   vocabulary   .   Beginning   with   basic   deontic   scorekeeping   attitudes   and   the   practices   <br> </br>
   that   govern   them   ,   an   account   is   offered   of   how   locutions   must   be   used   in   order   to   express   explicitly   the   very   normative   notions-is   committed   ,   is   permitted   <br> </br>
   ,   ought   ,   and   so   on-that   are   appealed   to   in   laying   out   the   normative   pragmatics   .   This   is   an   explication   of   explicitly   normative   conceptual   contents   in   <br> </br>
   terms   of   implicitly   normative   practices   ,   rather   than   a   reduction   of   normative   terms   to   nonnormative   ones   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   illuminates   the   normative   dimension   of   discursive   practice   in   line   with   the   methodological   principle   that   implicit   structures   are   often   best   <br> </br>
   understood   by   looking   at   how   they   can   be   made   explicit   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   first   step   in   the   project   is   accordingly   the   elaboration   of  <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> a </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> pragmatics </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> a </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> theory </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> of </span></span></span>  the   use   of   language   )   that   is   couched   in   terms   of   practical   <br> </br>
   scorekeeping   attitudes   of   attributing   and   acknowledging   deontic   statuses   of   commitment   and   entitlement   .   The   pragmatic   significance   of   <br> </br>
   performanceseventually   ,   speech   acts   such   as   assertions-is   then   understood   to   consist   in   the   difference   those   performances   make   to   the   commitments   and   <br> </br>
   entitlements   attributed   by   various   scorekeepers   .   The   next   step   is   to   say   what   structure   such   a   set   of   social   practices   must   have   in   order   to   qualify   as   <br> </br>
   specifically   discursive   practice   .   This   is   a   matter   of   moving   from   pragmatics   to   semantics   .   <br> </br>

   It   is   argued   in   Chapter   2   that   propositional   contentfulness   should   be   understood   in   terms   of   inferential   articulation   propositions   are   what   can   serve   as   <br> </br>
   premises   and   conclusions   of   inferences   ,   that   is   ,   can   serve   as   and   stand   in   need   of   reasons   .   <br> </br>

   in   two   different   directions   .   First   ,   it   is   shown   how   this   model   can   be   applied   in   order   to   understand   not   only   linguistic   meanings   but   intentional   contents   <br> </br>
   generally   .   The   propositional   contentfulness   of   beliefs   ,   no   less   than   of   claims   ,   should   be   understood   in   terms   of   their   role   in   reasoning   of   various   kinds   <br> </br>

   Much   of   the   theoretical   work   done   by   the   concept   of   belief   can   be   done   instead   by   appeal   to   this   sort   of   deontic   status   ,   and   to   the   practical   scorekeeping   <br> </br>
   attitudes   of   acknowledging   or   undertaking   such   commitments   .   A   social   ,   linguistic   account   of   intentionality   is   accordingly   elaborated   in   Chapter   3   .   It   <br> </br>
   is   extended   in   Chapter   4   to   incorporate   treatments   of   perception   and   action   and   of   the   contribution   those   phenomena   make   to   the   empirical   and   practical   <br> </br>
   dimensions   of   the   propositional   contents   of   the   states   ,   acts   ,   and   attitudes   involved   in   them   .   It   is   not   denied   that   it   makes   sense   to   talk   about   <br> </br>
   nonlinguistic   creatures   as   having   intentional   states   ,   but   it   is   claimed   that   our   understanding   of   such   talk   is   parasitic   on   our   understanding   of   the   sort   <br> </br>
   of   full-blooded   linguistic   intentionality   characteristic   of   states   and   attitudes   that   only   beings   who   engage   in   discursive   social   practices   can   have   .   <br> </br>
   This   story   amounts   ,   then   ,   to   an   account   of   the   relations   of   mindedness-in   the   sense   of   sapience   rather   than   mere   sentience-to   behavior   .   As   in   the   parallel   <br> </br>
   case   of   meaning   and   use   ,   the   clarification   of   these   relations   must   begin   with   a   determination   of   what   vocabulary   it   is   admissible   to   use   in   specifying   the   <br> </br>
   relevant   behavior   again   there   is   a   spectrum   of   possibilities   ,   from   allowing   intentional   vocabulary   with   semantic   locutions   ,   such   as   I   acting   as   if   one   <br> </br>
   believed   that   snow   is   white   ,   ranging   down   to   restrictions   to   physicalistic   or   other   naturalistic   vocabulary   ,   such   as   ones   left   wrist   rotating   twenty   <br> </br>
   degrees   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   via   media   pursued   here   eschews   intentional   or   semantic   specifications   of   behavior   but   permits   normative   and   therefore   social   specifications   of   <br> </br>
   what   is   in   fact   linguistic   behavior   .   Where   the   first   sort   of   generalization   involves   moving   from   consideration   of   language   to   consideration   of   mind   ,   <br> </br>
   from   talking   to   thinking   and   believing   ,   the   second   involves   moving   from   an   account   of   the   practices   that   constitute   treating   something   as   proposition   <br> </br>
   ally   contentful   to   the   practices   that   constitute   treating   something   as   conceptually   contentful   in   a   broader   sense   .   In   Chapter   6   the   notion   of   <br> </br>
   substitution   and   substitutional   inferences   is   used   to   show   how   expressions   such   as   singular   terms   and   predicates   ,   which   can   not   directly   play   the   <br> </br>
   inferential   role   of   premise   or   conclusion   in   an   argument   ,   nonetheless   can   play   an   indirectly   inferential   role   in   virtue   of   their   systematic   <br> </br>
   contributions   to   the   directly   inferential   roles   of   sentences   in   which   they   xvi   Preface   occur   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   Chapter   7   the   notion   of   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> anaphora </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> whose </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> paradigm </span></span></span></span>  <br> </br>

   demonstrative   tokenings   play   substitution-inferential   roles   and   hence   express   conceptual   contents   .   The   result   is   a   kind   of   conceptual-role   <br> </br>
   semantics   that   is   distinguished   first   by   the   nature   of   the   functional   system   with   respect   to   which   such   roles   are   individuated   and   attributed   :   what   is   <br> </br>
   appealed   to   is   role   in   the   implicitly   normative   linguistic   social   practices   of   a   community   ,   rather   than   the   behavioral   economy   of   a   single   individual   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   also   different   from   familiar   ways   of   using   the   notion   of   conceptual   role   in   conceiving   of   the   conceptual   in   terms   of   specifically   inferential   <br> </br>
   articulation   ,   and   in   its   elaboration   of   the   fundamental   substitutional   and   anaphoric   substructures   of   that   inferential   articulation   .   This   semantic   <br> </br>
   explanatory   strategy   ,   which   takes   inference   as   its   basic   concept   ,   contrasts   with   the   one   that   has   been   dominant   since   the   Enlightenment   ,   which   takes   <br> </br>
   representation   as   its   basic   concept   .   The   inferentialist   approach   is   by   no   means   without   precedent-though   it   has   been   largely   a   minority   platform   .
