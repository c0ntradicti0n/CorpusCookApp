   India   Printed   in   Great   Britain   on   acid-free   paper   by   CPI   Antony   Rowe   The   core   of   this   book   is   its   second   Part   .   In   one   long   movement   of   thought   ,   these   chapters   <br> </br>
   (   IIIXII   )   sketch   what   the   textbook   taxonomists   would   label   an   ‘   ethics   ’   ,   a   ‘   political   philosophy   ’   ,   and   a   ‘   philosophy   of   law   ’   or   ‘   jurisprudence   ’   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   may   accept   the   labels   ,   as   a   scholarly   convenience   ,   but   not   the   implication   that   the   ‘   disciplines   ’   they   identify   are   really   distinct   and   can   safely   be   <br> </br>
   pursued   apart   .   Parts   One   and   Three   are   ,   in   a   sense   ,   outriders   .   Anyone   interested   in   natural   law   simply   as   an   ethics   may   omit   Chapter   I   anyone   whose   concerns   <br> </br>
   are   limited   to   jurisprudence   may   omit   Chapter   XIII   .   And   those   who   want   to   see   ,   in   advance   ,   how   the   whole   study   yields   an   understanding   very   different   from   <br> </br>
   the   accounts   of   ‘   natural   law   ’   in   their   textbooks   of   jurisprudence   and   philosophy   might   turn   first   to   Chapter   XII   ,   and   then   perhaps   to   Chapter   II   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> book </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   no   more </span>  than  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> introductory </span>  .   Countless   relevant   matters   are   merely   touched   upon   or   are   passed   over   altogether   .   Innumerable   objections   receive   <br> </br>
   no   more   than   the   silent   tribute   of   an   effort   to   draft   statements   that   would   prove   defensible   if   a   defence   against   objections   were   explicitly   undertaken   .   <br> </br>
   No   effort   is   made   to   give   an   ordered   account   of   the   long   history   of   theorizing   about   natural   law   and   natural   rights   .   For   experience   suggests   that   such   <br> </br>
   accounts   lull   rather   than   stimulate   an   interest   in   their   subject-matter   .   And   indeed   ,   the   history   of   these   theories   can   only   be   properly   understood   by   one   <br> </br>
   who   appreciates   the   intrinsic   problems   of   human   good   and   practical   reasonableness   with   which   the   theorists   were   grappling   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   my   prior   concern   is   to   give   my   own   response   to   those   problems   ,   mentioning   other   theories   only   where   I   think   they   can   both   illuminate   and   be   illuminated   by   <br> </br>
   the   theory   presented   in   this   book   .   My   hope   is   that   a   re-presentation   and   development   of   main   elements   of   the   ‘   classical   ’   or   ‘   mainstream   ’   theories   of   <br> </br>
   natural   law   ,   by   way   of   an   argument   on   the   merits   (   as   lawyers   say   )   ,   will   be   found   useful   by   those   who   want   to   understand   the   history   of   ideas   as   well   as   by   those   <br> </br>
   interested   in   forming   or   reforming   their   own   view   of   the   merits   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Every </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> author </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> has   his   milieu   this   book   has   roots   in   a   modern   tradition   that   can   be   labelled   ‘   analytical   jurisprudence   ’   ,   and   my   own   interest   in   that </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> tradition   antedates   the   time   when   I   first   began   to   suspect   that   there   might   be   more   to   theories   of   natural   law   than   superstition   and   darkness </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Someone   who   shared   my   theory   of   natural   law   ,   but   whose   focus   of   interest   and   competence   was   ,   say   ,   sociological   jurisprudence   or   political   theory   or   moral   <br> </br>
   theology   ,   would   have   written   a   different   book   .   In   1953   Leo   Strauss   prefaced   his   study   of   natural   law   with   the   warning   that   ‘   the   issue   of   natural   right   <br> </br>
   presents   itself   today   as   a   matter   of   party   allegiance   .   Looking   around   us   ,   we   see   two   hostile   camps   ,   heavily   fortified   and   guarded   .   One   is   occupied   by   the   <br> </br>
   liberals   of   various   descriptions   ,   the   other   by   the   Catholic   and   non-Catholic   disciples   of   Thomas   Aquinas’.1   Things   have   changed   during   the   last   25   years   <br> </br>
   ,   and   the   debate   need   no   longer   be   regarded   as   so   polarized   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Still   ,   the   issues   tackled   in  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> this   book </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> go   to   the   root   of   every   human   effort   ,   commitment   ,   and   allegiance   ,   and   at   the   same   time   are   overlaid   with   a   long   and </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> continuing   history   of   fierce   partisanship </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> So   it   may   be   as   well   to   point   out   that   in   this   book   nothing   is   asserted   or   defended   by   appeal   to   the   authority   of </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> any   person   or   body </span>  .   I   do   quite   frequently   refer   to   Thomas   Aquinas   ,   because   on   any   view   he   occupies   a   uniquely   strategic   place   in   the   history   of   natural   law   <br> </br>
   theorizing   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Likewise   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> refer </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> occasionally </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> to </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> Roman </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Catholic </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Church </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ’s </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> pronouncements </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> on </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> natural </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> law </span></span>  ,   because   that   body   is   perhaps   unique   in   the   modern   world   in   <br> </br>
   claiming   to   be   an   authoritative   exponent   of   natural   law   .   But   ,   while   there   is   place   for   appeal   to   ,   and   deference   to   ,   authority   ,   that   place   is   not   in   <br> </br>
   philosophical   argument   about   the   merits   of   theories   or   the   right   response   to   practical   problems   ,   and   so   is   not   in   this   book   .   My   arguments   ,   then   ,   stand   or   <br> </br>
   fall   by   their   own   reasonableness   or   otherwise   .   But   that   is   not   to   say   that   there   is   much   that   is   original   in   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   debts   to   Plato   ,   Aristotle   ,   Aquinas   ,   and   other   authors   in   that   ‘   classical   ’   tradition   are   recorded   in   the   footnotes   and   in   the   more   discursive   notes   <br> </br>
   following   each   chapter   .   My   debt   to   Germain   Grisez   is   similarly   acknowledged   ,   but   calls   for   explicit   mention   here   .   The   ethical   theory   advanced   in   <br> </br>
   Chapters   IIIV   and   the   theoretical   arguments   in   sections   VI.2   and   XIII.2   are   squarely   based   on   my   understanding   of   his   vigorous   re-presentation   and   very   <br> </br>
   substantial   development   of   the   classical   arguments   on   these   matters   .   I   have   ,   of   course   ,   many   other   debts   ,   particularly   to   David   Alston   ,   David   Braine   ,   <br> </br>

   social   science   There   are   human   goods   that   can   be   secured   only   through   the   institutions   of   human   law   ,   and   requirements   of   practical   reasonableness   that   <br> </br>
   only   those   institutions   can   satisfy   .   It   is   the   object   of   this   book   to   identify   those   goods   ,   and   those   requirements   of   practical   reasonableness   ,   and   thus   <br> </br>
   to   show   how   and   on   what   conditions   such   institutions   are   justified   and   the   ways   in   which   they   can   be   (   and   often   are   )   defective   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   often   supposed   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> an   evaluation   of   law   as   a   type   of   social   institution </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   if   it   is   to   be   undertaken   at   all   ,   must   be   preceded   by   a   value-free   description </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> and   analysis   of   that   institution   as   it   exists   in   fact </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   development   of   modern   jurisprudence   suggests   ,   and   reflection   on   the   methodology   of   any   social   science   confirms   ,   that   no   theorist   can   give   a   <br> </br>
   theoretical   description   and   analysis   of   social   facts   without   also   participating   in   the   work   of   evaluation   ,   of   understanding   what   is   really   good   for   <br> </br>
   human   persons   ,   and   what   is   really   required   by   practical   reasonableness   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> social   science </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   such   as   analytical   or   sociological   jurisprudence   ,   seeks   to </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> describe   ,   analyse   ,   and   explain   some   object   or   subject-matter   .   This   object   is   constituted   by   human   actions   ,   practices   ,   habits   ,   dispositions   ,   and   by </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> human   discourse </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   actions   ,   practices   ,   etc   .   ,   are   certainly   influenced   by   the   ‘   natural   ’   causes   properly   investigated   by   the   methods   of   the   natural   sciences   ,   including   <br> </br>
   a   part   of   the   science   of   psychology   .   But   the   actions   ,   practices   ,   etc   .   ,   can   be   fully   understood   only   by   understanding   their   point   ,   that   is   to   say   their   <br> </br>
   objective   ,   their   value   ,   their   significance   or   importance   ,   as   conceived   by   the   people   who   performed   them   ,   engaged   in   them   ,   etc   .   And   these   conceptions   of   <br> </br>
   point   ,   value   ,   significance   ,   and   importance   will   be   reflected   in   the   discourse   of   those   same   people   ,   in   the   con-   ceptual   distinctions   they   draw   and   fail   or   <br> </br>
   refuse   to   draw   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Moreover   ,   these   actions   ,   practices   ,   etc   .   ,   and   correspondingly   these   concepts   ,   vary   greatly   from   person   to   person   ,   from   one   society   to   another   ,   from   one   <br> </br>
   time   and   place   to   other   times   and   places   .   How   ,   then   ,   is   there   to   be   a   general   descriptive   theory   of   these   varying   particulars   ?   A   theorist   wishes   to   describe   <br> </br>
   ,   say   ,   law   as   a   social   institution   .   But   the   conceptions   of   law   (   and   of   jus   ,   lex   ,   droit   ,   nomos   ,   .   .   .   )   which   people   have   entertained   ,   and   have   used   to   shape   <br> </br>
   their   own   conduct   ,   are   quite   varied   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   subject-matter   of   the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> theorist   ’s   description </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> does   not   come   neatly   demarcated   from   other   features   of   social   life   and   practice </span>  .   Moreover   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> this   social </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> life   and   practice </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> bears   labels   in   many   languages </span>  .   The   languages   can   be   learned   by   speakers   of   other   languages   ,   but   the   principles   on   which   labels   are   <br> </br>
   adopted   and   appliedi.e   .   the   practical   concerns   and   the   self-interpretations   of   the   people   whose   conduct   and   dispositions   go   to   make   up   the   theorist   ’s   <br> </br>
   subjectmatterare   not   uniform   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Can   the   theorist   do   more   ,   then   ,   than   list   these   varying   conceptions   and   practices   and   their   corresponding   labels   ?   Even   a   list   requires   some   principle   of   <br> </br>
   selection   of   items   for   inclusion   in   the   list   .   And   jurisprudence   ,   like   other   social   sciences   ,   aspires   to   be   more   than   a   conjunction   of   lexicography   with   <br> </br>
   local   history   ,   or   even   than   a   juxtaposition   of   all   lexicographies   conjoined   with   all   local   histories   .   How   does   the   theorist   decide   what   is   to   count   as   law   <br> </br>
   for   the   purposes   of   his   description   ?   The   early   analytical   jurists   do   not   show   much   awareness   of   the   problem   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Neither   Bentham   nor   Austin   advances   any   reason   or   justification   for   the   definitions   of   law   and   jurisprudence   which   he   favours   .   Each   tries   to   show   how   the   <br> </br>
   data   of   legal   experience   can   be   explained   in   terms   of   those   definitions   .   But   the   definitions   are   simply   posited   at   the   outset   and   thereafter   taken   for   <br> </br>
   granted   .   Bentham   ’s   notion   of   the   ‘   real   elements   ’   of   ideas   encourages   us   to   speculate   that   he   was   attracted   to   his   definition   of   a   law   (   ‘   an   assemblage   of   <br> </br>
   signs   declarative   of   a   volition   conceived   or   adopted   by   the   sovereign   in   a   state   .   .   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ’   1   )   by   the   fact   that   assemblages   of   signs   (   and   the   commands   and   prohibitions   of   a   definite   individual   or   set   of   individuals   )   are   ‘   real   entities   ’   that   make   <br> </br>
   an   empirical   impres-   sion   on   the   mind   .   Austin   ’s   obiter   dicta   on   methodology   suggest   that   for   him   the   attraction   of   the   notions   of   command   ,   political   <br> </br>
   superior   ,   and   habit   of   obedience   was   precisely   their   simplicity   and   definiteness   .   He   seems   to   have   wanted   the   ‘   leading   terms   ’   of   his   explanatory   system   <br> </br>
   to   have   the   ‘   simplicity   and   definiteness   ’   found   in   the   ‘   method   so   successfully   pursued   by   geometers’.2   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   he   did   not   mind   either   the   complexity   of   some   of   the   conclusions   (   e.g.   as   to   sovereignty   in   federations   )   necessitated   by   his   definitional   premisses   ,   or   <br> </br>
   the   novelty   and   artificiality   of   others   among   those   conclusions   (   e.g.   as   to   the   extralegal   character   of   constitutional   law   ,   or   the   non-existence   of   <br> </br>
   legal   rights   of   the   sovereign   )   .   He   prized   the   ‘   fewness   ’   of   his   leading   terms   3   every   reader   of   Austin   becomes   aware   of   the   consequent   flattening   or   <br> </br>
   thinning-out   of   the   account   of   legal   experience   .   In   Kelsen   ’s   ‘   general   theory   of   law   ’   we   find   no   critical   attention   to   the   methodological   problem   of   <br> </br>
   selecting   concepts   for   the   purposes   of   a   value-free   or   descriptive   general   theory   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> We   do   find   an   awareness   ,   not   apparent   in   Bentham   and   Austin   ,   that   point   or   function   is   intrinsic   to   the   constitution   ,   and   hence   to   the   descriptive </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> understanding   ,   of   the   subjectmatter </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> So </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Kelsen </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> defines   law   as   a   specific   social   technique   :   ‘   the   social   technique   which   consists   in   bringing   about   the   desired   social   conduct   of   men   through   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> threat   of   a   measure   of   coercion   which   is   to   be   applied   in   case   of   contrary   conduct’.4   From   this   he   derives   his   characterization   of   the   individual   legal   norm </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as   a   norm   for   the   application   of   a   sanction   ,   and   from   this   in   turn   follow   the   other   features   of   his   ‘   nomostatics   ’   and   several   features   of   his   ‘   nomodynamics   ’ </span>  <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   how   does   Kelsen   propose   to   justify   the   definition   itself   ?   Simply   as   follows   :  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> What   could   the   social   order   of   a   negro   tribe   under   the   leadership   of   a </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> despotic   chieftainan   order   likewise   called   ‘   law’have   in   common   with   the   constitution   of   the   Swiss   republic </span>  ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   for   the   promotion   of   peace   ’   (   ibid   .   ,   21   )   hence   ‘   Law   is   an   order   according   to   which   the   use   of   force   is   generally   forbidden   but   exceptionally   ,   under   certain   <br> </br>
   circumstances   and   for   certain   individuals   ,   permitted   as   a   sanction   ’   (   ibid   .   ,   22   )   see   also   ibid   .   ,   392   ,   399   .   [   Let   us   interject   to   ask   :   Who   is   doing   this   <br> </br>
   calling   ,   this   naming   ?   Whose   willingness   so   to   refer   to   the   tribe   ’s   social   order   (   in   language   expressing   distinctions   which   the   despotic   chieftain   and   <br> </br>
   his   subjects   do   not   care   to   make   )   is   thus   being   made   decisive   ?   ]   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   there   is   a   common   element   that   fully   justifies   this   terminology   .   .   .   for   the   word   refers   to   that   specific   social   technique   which   ,   despite   the   vast   <br> </br>
   differences   .   .   .   is   yet   essentially   the   same   for   all   these   peoples   differing   so   much   in   time   ,   in   place   ,   and   in   culture   .   .   .   What   could   be   simpler   ?   One   takes   the   <br> </br>
   word   ‘   law   ’   .   Ignoring   a   wide   range   of   meanings   and   reference   (   as   in   ‘   law   of   nature   ’   ,   ‘   moral   law   ’   ,   ‘   sociological   law   ’   ,   ‘   international   law   ’   ,   ‘   <br> </br>
   ecclesiastical   law   ’   ,   ‘   law   of   grammar   ’   )   ,   and   further   ignoring   alternative   ways   of   referring   to   ,   e.g.   ,   the   ‘   negro   tribe   ’s   ’   social   order   ,   one   looks   at   the   <br> </br>
   range   of   subject-matter   signified   by   the   word   in   the   usage   which   one   has   (   without   explanation   )   selected   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   looks   for   ‘   a   common   element   ’   .
