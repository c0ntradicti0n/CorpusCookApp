   <br> </br>
   Neither   Bentham   nor   Austin   advances   any   reason   or   justification   for   the   definitions   of   law   and   jurisprudence   which   he   favours   .   Each   tries   to   show   how   the   <br> </br>
   data   of   legal   experience   can   be   explained   in   terms   of   those   definitions   .   But   the   definitions   are   simply   posited   at   the   outset   and   thereafter   taken   for   <br> </br>
   granted   .   Bentham   ’s   notion   of   the   ‘   real   elements   ’   of   ideas   encourages   us   to   speculate   that   he   was   attracted   to   his   definition   of   a   law   (   ‘   an   assemblage   of   <br> </br>
   signs   declarative   of   a   volition   conceived   or   adopted   by   the   sovereign   in   a   state   .   .   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ’   1   )   by   the   fact   that   assemblages   of   signs   (   and   the   commands   and   prohibitions   of   a   definite   individual   or   set   of   individuals   )   are   ‘   real   entities   ’   that   make   <br> </br>

   with   the   constitution   of   the   Swiss   republic   ?   Yet   there   is   a   common   element   that   fully   justifies   this   terminology   .   .   .   for   the   word   refers   to   that   specific   <br> </br>
   social   technique   which   ,   despite   the   vast   differences   .   .   .   is   yet   essentially   the   same   for   all   these   peoples   differing   so   much   in   time   ,   in   place   ,   and   in   <br> </br>
   culture   .   .   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   What   could   be   simpler   ?   One   takes   the   word   ‘   law   ’   .   Ignoring   a   wide   range   of   meanings   and   reference   (   as   in   ‘   law   of   nature   ’   ,   ‘   moral   law   ’   ,   ‘   sociological   law   ’   ,   ‘   <br> </br>
   international   law   ’   ,   ‘   ecclesiastical   law   ’   ,   ‘   law   of   grammar   ’   )   ,   and   further   ignoring   alternative   ways   of   referring   to   ,   e.g.   ,   the   ‘   negro   tribe   ’s   ’   social   <br> </br>
   order   ,   one   looks   at   the   range   of   subject-matter   signified   by   the   word   in   the   usage   which   one   has   (   without   explanation   )   selected   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   One   looks   for   ‘   a   common   element   ’   .   This   one   thing   common   is   the   criterion   of   the   ‘   essence   ’   of   law   ,   and   thus   the   one   feature   used   to   characterize   and   to   explain   <br> </br>
   descriptively   the   whole   subject-matter   .   There   is   thus   one   concept   ,   which   can   be   predicated   equally   and   in   the   same   sense   (   i.e.   univocally   )   of   everything   <br> </br>
   which   ,   in   a   pre-theoretical   usage   (   which   the   theorist   allows   to   determine   his   theoretical   usage   )   ,   somebody   was   willing   to   call   ‘   law   ’   .   The   noticeably   <br> </br>
   greater   explanatory   power   of   later   descriptive   analyses   of   law   ,   such   as   those   of   H.   L.   A.   Hart   and   Joseph   Raz   ,   is   to   be   attributed   to   their   fairly   decisive   <br> </br>
   break   with   the   rather   naive   methodologies   of   Bentham   ,   Austin   ,   and   Kelsen   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   sophistication   of   method   has   three   principal   features   ,   discussed   in   the   following   three   sections   .   i.3   selection   of   central   case   The   obvious   <br> </br>
   question   provoked   by   the   course   of   theorizing   sketched   in   the   preceding   section   is   :   From   what   viewpoint   ,   and   relative   to   what   concerns   ,   are   importance   <br> </br>
   and   significance   to   be   assessed   ?   Before   we   consider   that   question   ,   however   ,   it   will   be   as   well   to   identify   the   philosophical   device   which   enables   an   <br> </br>
   increasingly   differentiated   description   of   law   to   be   offered   as   still   a   general   theory   of   law   .   Aristotle   introduced   ,   discussed   ,   and   regularly   employed   <br> </br>
   the   device   ,   not   least   in   his   philosophy   of   human   affairs   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   He   called   it   the   identification   of   focal   meaning   (   pros   hen   or   aph’henos   homonymy   )   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   device   is   or   corresponds   to   a   main   component   in </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Max   Weber </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ’s   not   too </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> clearly   explained   methodological   device   ,   the   ideal-type </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   involves   a   conscious   departure   from   the   assumption   upon   which   ,   as   we   saw   ,   Kelsen   proceeded   :   that   The   general   traits   which   mark   a   system   as   a   legal   one   are   <br> </br>
   several   and   each   of   them   admits   ,   in   principle   ,   of   various   degrees   .   In   typical   instances   of   legal   systems   all   these   traits   are   manifested   to   a   very   high   <br> </br>
   degree   .   But   it   is   possible   to   find   systems   in   which   all   or   some   are   present   only   to   a   lesser   degree   or   in   which   one   or   two   are   absent   altogether   .   .   .When   faced   <br> </br>
   with   borderline   cases   it   is   best   to   admit   their   problematic   credentials   ,   to   enumerate   their   similarities   and   dissimilarities   to   the   typical   cases   ,   and   <br> </br>
   leave   it   at   that.23   Because   the   word   ‘   typical   ’   may   suggest   that   the   relevant   criterion   is   statistical   frequency   (   whether   in   human   history   ,   or   today   )   ,   I   <br> </br>
   prefer   to   call   the   states   of   affairs   referred   to   by   a   theoretical   concept   in   its   focal   meaning   the   central   case(s   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   there   are   central   cases   ,   as   Aristotle   insisted   ,   of   friendship   ,   and   there   are   more   or   less   peripheral   cases   (   business   friendship   ,   friendship   of   <br> </br>
   convenience   ,   cupboard   love   ,   casual   and   play   relations   ,   and   so   on   :   see   VI.4   )   .   There   are   central   cases   of   constitutional   government   ,   and   there   are   <br> </br>
   peripheral   cases   (   such   as   Hitler   ’s   Germany   ,   Stalin   ’s   Russia   ,   or   even   Amin   ’s   Uganda   )   .   On   the   one   hand   ,   there   is   no   point   in   denying   that   the   peripheral   <br> </br>
   cases   are   instances   (   of   friendship   ,   constitutionality   .   .   .   )   .   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> but   also   in   each   of   the   peripheral   cases </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Rather   ,   one   ’s   descriptive   explanation   of   the   central   cases   should   be   as   conceptually   rich   and   complex   as   is   required   to   answer   all   appropriate   questions   <br> </br>
   about   those   central   cases   .   And   then   one   ’s   account   of   the   other   instances   can   trace   the   network   of   similarities   and   differences   ,   the   analogies   and   <br> </br>
   disanalogies   ,   for   example   ,   of   form   ,   function   ,   or   content   ,   between   them   and   the   central   cases   .   In   this   way   ,   one   uncovers   the   ‘   principle   or   rationale   ’   on   <br> </br>
   which   the   general   term   (   ‘   constitution   ’   ,   ‘   friend   ’   ,   ‘   law   ’   .   .   .   )   is   extended   from   the   central   to   the   more   or   less   borderline   cases   ,   from   its   focal   to   its   <br> </br>
   secondary   meanings   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   i.4   selection   of   viewpoint   But   by   what   criteria   is   one   meaning   to   be   accounted   focal   and   another   secondary   ,   one   state   of   affairs   central   and   another   <br> </br>
   borderline   ?   This   is   simply   a   reformulation   of   the   question   left   over   from   I.2   :   From   what   viewpoint   ,   and   relative   to   what   concerns   ,   are   importance   and   <br> </br>
   significance   to   be   assessed   ?   validity   of   the   norms   and   follow   them   ’   (   paradigmatically   ,   the   viewpoint   of   the   judge   qua   judge).30   The   conclusion   we   should   <br> </br>
   draw   is   clear   .   If   there   is   a   point   of   view   in   which   legal   obligation   is   treated   as   at   least   presumptively   a   moral   obligation   (   and   thus   as   of   ‘   great   importance   <br> </br>

   would   have   replied   that   indeed   it   was   complex   ,   debated   ,   and   disputed   ,   and   that   they   had   made   rather   extensive   contributions   to   the   debate.23   For   the   real   <br> </br>
   problem   of   morality   ,   and   of   the   point   or   meaning   of   human   existence   ,   is   not   in   discerning   the   basic   aspects   of   human   well-being   ,   but   in   integrating   those   <br> </br>
