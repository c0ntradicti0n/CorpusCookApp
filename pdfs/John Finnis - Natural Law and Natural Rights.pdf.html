   In   one   long   movement   of   thought   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> these </span></span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> chapters </span></span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> IIIXII </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span></span>  sketch   what   the   textbook   taxonomists   would   label   an   ‘   ethics   ’   ,   a   ‘   political   philosophy   ’   ,   and   a   ‘   <br> </br>
   philosophy   of   law   ’   or   ‘   jurisprudence   ’   .   We   may   accept   the   labels   ,   as   a   scholarly   convenience   ,   but   not   the   implication   that   the   ‘   disciplines   ’   they   <br> </br>
   identify   are   really   distinct   and   can   safely   be   pursued   apart   .   Parts   One   and   Three   are   ,   in   a   sense   ,   outriders   .   Anyone   interested   in   natural   law   simply   as   an   <br> </br>
   ethics   may   omit   Chapter   I   anyone   whose   concerns   are   limited   to   jurisprudence   may   omit   Chapter   XIII   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   And   those   who   want   to   see   ,   in   advance   ,   how   the   whole   study   yields   an   understanding   very   different   from   the   accounts   of   ‘   natural   law   ’   in   their   textbooks   of   <br> </br>
   jurisprudence   and   philosophy   might   turn   first   to   Chapter   XII   ,   and   then   perhaps   to   Chapter   II   .   The   book   is   no   more   than   introductory   .   Countless   relevant   <br> </br>
   matters   are   merely   touched   upon   or   are   passed   over   altogether   .   Innumerable   objections   receive   no   more   than   the   silent   tribute   of   an   effort   to   draft   <br> </br>
   statements   that   would   prove   defensible   if   a   defence   against   objections   were   explicitly   undertaken   .   No   effort   is   made   to   give   an   ordered   account   of   the   <br> </br>
   long   history   of   theorizing   about   natural   law   and   natural   rights   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   experience   suggests   that   such   accounts   lull   rather   than   stimulate   an   interest   in   their   subject-matter   .   And   indeed   ,   the   history   of   these   theories   can   <br> </br>
   only   be   properly   understood   by   one   who   appreciates   the   intrinsic   problems   of   human   good   and   practical   reasonableness   with   which   the   theorists   were   <br> </br>
   grappling   .   So   my   prior   concern   is   to   give   my   own   response   to   those   problems   ,   mentioning   other   theories   only   where   I   think   they   can   both   illuminate   and   be   <br> </br>
   illuminated   by   the   theory   presented   in   this   book   .   My   hope   is   that   a   re-presentation   and   development   of   main   elements   of   the   ‘   classical   ’   or   ‘   mainstream   ’   <br> </br>
   theories   of   natural   law   ,   by   way   of   an   argument   on  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> merits </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   as   lawyers   say   ) </span>  ,   will   be   found   useful   by   those   who   want   to   understand   the   history   of   ideas   as   well   <br> </br>
   as   by   those   interested   in   forming   or   reforming   their   own   view   of   the   merits   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Every   author   has   his   milieu   this   book   has   roots   in   a   modern   tradition   that   can   be   labelled   ‘   analytical   jurisprudence   ’   ,   and   my   own   interest   in   that   <br> </br>
   tradition   antedates   the   time   when   I   first   began   to   suspect   that   there   might   be   more   to   theories   of   natural   law   than   superstition   and   darkness   .   Someone   who   <br> </br>
   shared   my   theory   of   natural   law   ,   but   whose   focus   of   interest   and   competence   was   ,   say   ,   sociological   jurisprudence   or   political   theory   or   moral   theology   ,   <br> </br>
   would   have   written   a   different   book   .   In   1953   Leo   Strauss   prefaced   his   study   of   natural   law   with   the   warning   that   ‘   the   issue   of   natural   right   presents   itself   <br> </br>
   today   as   a   matter   of   party   allegiance   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Looking   around   us   ,   we   see   two   hostile   camps   ,   heavily   fortified   and   guarded   .   One   is   occupied   by   the   liberals   of   various   descriptions   ,   the   other   by   the   <br> </br>
   Catholic   and   non-Catholic   disciples   of   Thomas   Aquinas’.1   Things   have   changed   during   the   last   25   years   ,   and   the   debate   need   no   longer   be   regarded   as   so   <br> </br>
   polarized   .   Still   ,   the   issues   tackled   in   this   book   go   to   the   root   of   every   human   effort   ,   commitment   ,   and   allegiance   ,   and   at   the   same   time   are   overlaid   with   a   <br> </br>
   long   and   continuing   history   of   fierce   partisanship   .   So   it   may   be   as   well   to   point   out   that   in   this   book   nothing   is   asserted   or   defended   by   appeal   to   the   <br> </br>
   authority   of   any   person   or   body   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   do   quite   frequently   refer   to   Thomas   Aquinas   ,   because   on   any   view   he   occupies   a   uniquely   strategic   place   in   the   history   of   natural   law   theorizing   .   <br> </br>
   Likewise   ,   I   refer   occasionally   to   the   Roman   Catholic   Church   ’s   pronouncements   on   natural   law   ,   because   that   body   is   perhaps   unique   in   the   modern   world   in   <br> </br>
   claiming   to   be   an   authoritative   exponent   of   natural   law   .   But   ,   while   there   is   place   for   appeal   to   ,   and   deference   to   ,   authority   ,   that   place   is   not   in   <br> </br>
   philosophical   argument   about   the   merits   of   theories   or   the   right   response   to   practical   problems   ,   and   so   is   not   in   this   book   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   arguments   ,   then   ,   stand   or   fall   by   their   own   reasonableness   or   otherwise   .   But   that   is   not   to   say   that   there   is   much   that   is   original   in   them   .   My   debts   to   <br> </br>
   Plato   ,   Aristotle   ,   Aquinas   ,   and   other   authors   in   that   ‘   classical   ’   tradition   are   recorded   in   the   footnotes   and   in   the   more   discursive   notes   following   each   <br> </br>
   chapter   .   My   debt   to   Germain   Grisez   is   similarly   acknowledged   ,   but   calls   for   explicit   mention   here   .   The   ethical   theory   advanced   in   Chapters   IIIV   and   the   <br> </br>
   theoretical   arguments   in   sections   VI.2   and   XIII.2   are   squarely   based   on   my   understanding   of   his   vigorous   re-presentation   and   very   substantial   <br> </br>
   development   of   the   classical   arguments   on   these   matters   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   ,   of   course   ,   many   other   debts   ,   particularly   to   David   Alston   ,   David   Braine   ,   Michael   Detmold   ,   Germain   Grisez   ,   H.   L.   A.   Hart   ,   Neil   MacCormick   ,   J.   L.   <br> </br>
   Mackie   ,   Carlos   Nino   ,   and   Joseph   Raz   ,   who   from   their   diverse   standpoints   offered   comments   on   the   whole   or   substantial   parts   of   a   draft   .   The   book   was   <br> </br>
   conceived   ,   begun   ,   and   finished   in   the   University   of   Oxford   ,   whose   motto   could   be   placed   at   the   end   of   Part   Three   .   But   the   book   was   mainly   written   in   Africa   ,   <br> </br>
   in   Chancellor   College   at   the   University   of   Malawi   ,   in   an   environment   at   once   congenial   and   conducive   to   contemplation   of   the   problems   of   justice   ,   law   ,   <br> </br>
   authority   ,   and   rights   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   March   1979   PREFACE   vii   This   page   intentionally   left   blank   The   text   of   the   first   edition   ,   including   its   footnotes   and   the   endnotes   to   each   chapter   ,   is   <br> </br>
   almost   unchanged   .   Typographical   and   other   formal   errors   have   been   corrected   ,   and   two   or   three   kinds   of   locution   whose   connotations   have   altered   <br> </br>
   significantly   since   1979   have   been   adjusted   .   Although   everything   has   been   reset   ,   the   pagination   is   the   same   ,   within   one   line   per   page   ,   up   to   the   point   <br> </br>
   where   the   Postscript   begins   ,   after   which   there   is   also   an   enlarged   Index   to   both   the   original   book   and   the   Postscript   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   aim   of   the   Postscript   is   not   to   say   everything   that   might   well   be   said   if   these   matters   were   to   be   treated   afresh   .   Rather   it   is   to   indicate   where   the   <br> </br>
   original   needs   ,   I   think   ,   amendment   or   supplementation   .   The   Postscript   begins   with   some   general   observations   ,   by   way   of   introductory   Overview   ,   and   then   <br> </br>
   comments   on   each   chapter   section   by   section   ,   in   sequence   .   In   the   Index   ,   references   to   pages   numbered   above   413   are   to   new   material   .   This   new   edition   was   <br> </br>
   prepared   in   conjunction   with   the   five   volumes   of   my  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Collected </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Essays </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   hereafter   CEJF   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   It   is   often   supposed   that   an   evaluation   of   law   as   a   type   of   social   institution   ,   if   it   is   to   be   undertaken   at   all   ,   must   be   preceded   by   a   value-free   description   <br> </br>
   and   analysis   of   that   institution   as   it   exists   in   fact   .   But   the   development   of   modern   jurisprudence   suggests   ,   and   reflection   on   the   methodology   of   any   <br> </br>
   social   science   confirms   ,   that   no   theorist   can   give   a   theoretical   description   and   analysis   of   social   facts   without   also   participating   in   the   work   of   <br> </br>
   evaluation   ,   of   understanding   what   is   really   good   for   human   persons   ,   and   what   is   really   required   by   practical   reasonableness   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   A   social   science   ,   such   as   analytical   or   sociological   jurisprudence   ,   seeks   to   describe   ,   analyse   ,   and   explain   some   object   or   subject-matter   .   This   object   <br> </br>
   is   constituted   by   human   actions   ,   practices   ,   habits   ,   dispositions   ,   and   by   human   discourse   .   The   actions   ,   practices   ,   etc   .   ,   are   certainly   influenced   by   <br> </br>
   the   ‘   natural   ’   causes   properly   investigated   by   the   methods   of   the   natural   sciences   ,   including   a   part   of   the   science   of   psychology   .   But   the   actions   ,   <br> </br>
   practices   ,   etc   .   ,   can   be   fully   understood   only   by   understanding   their   point   ,   that   is   to   say   their   objective   ,   their   value   ,   their   significance   or   <br> </br>
   importance   ,   as   conceived   by   the   people   who   performed   them   ,   engaged   in   them   ,   etc   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   And   these   conceptions   of   point   ,   value   ,   significance   ,   and   importance   will   be   reflected   in   the   discourse   of   those   same   people   ,   in   the   con-   ceptual   <br> </br>
   distinctions   they   draw   and   fail   or   refuse   to   draw   .   Moreover   ,   these   actions   ,   practices   ,   etc   .   ,   and   correspondingly   these   concepts   ,   vary   greatly   from   <br> </br>
   person   to   person   ,   from   one   society   to   another   ,   from   one   time   and   place   to   other   times   and   places   .   How   ,   then   ,   is   there   to   be   a   general   descriptive   theory   of   <br> </br>
   these   varying   particulars   ?   A   theorist   wishes   to   describe   ,   say   ,   law   as   a   social   institution   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   conceptions  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> of   law </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   and   of   jus   ,   lex   ,   droit   ,   nomos   , </span>  .   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   .   )   which   people   have   entertained   ,   and   have   used   to   shape   their   own   conduct   ,   are   quite   varied   .   The   subject-matter   of   the   theorist   ’s   description   does   not   <br> </br>
   come   neatly   demarcated   from   other   features   of   social   life   and   practice   .   Moreover   ,   this   social   life   and   practice   bears   labels   in   many   languages   .   The   <br> </br>
   languages   can   be   learned   by   speakers   of   other   languages   ,   but   the   principles   on   which   labels   are   adopted   and   appliedi.e   .   the   practical   concerns   and   the   <br> </br>
   self-interpretations   of   the   people   whose   conduct   and   dispositions   go   to   make   up   the   theorist   ’s   subjectmatterare   not   uniform   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Can   the   theorist   do   more   ,   then   ,   than   list   these   varying   conceptions   and   practices   and   their   corresponding   labels   ?   Even   a   list   requires   some   principle   of   <br> </br>
   selection   of   items   for   inclusion   in   the   list   .   And   jurisprudence   ,   like   other   social   sciences   ,   aspires   to   be   more   than   a   conjunction   of   lexicography   with   <br> </br>
   local   history   ,   or   even   than   a   juxtaposition   of   all   lexicographies   conjoined   with   all   local   histories   .   How   does   the   theorist   decide   what   is   to   count   as   law   <br> </br>
   for   the   purposes   of   his   description   ?   The   early   analytical   jurists   do   not   show   much   awareness   of   the   problem   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Neither   Bentham   nor   Austin   advances   any   reason   or   justification   for   the   definitions   of   law   and   jurisprudence   which   he   favours   .   Each   tries   to   show   how   the   <br> </br>
   data   of   legal   experience   can   be   explained   in   terms   of   those   definitions   .   But   the   definitions   are   simply   posited   at   the   outset   and   thereafter   taken   for   <br> </br>
   granted   .   Bentham   ’s   notion   of   the   ‘   real   elements   ’   of   ideas   encourages   us   to   speculate   that   he   was   attracted   to   his   definition   of  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> a   law </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   ‘   an   assemblage   of </span>  <br> </br>

   He   prized   the   ‘   fewness   ’   of   his   leading   terms   3   every   reader   of   Austin   becomes   aware   of   the   consequent   flattening   or   thinning-out   of   the   account   of   legal   <br> </br>
   experience   .   In   Kelsen   ’s   ‘   general   theory   of   law   ’   we   find   no   critical   attention   to   the   methodological   problem   of   selecting   concepts   for   the   purposes   of   a   <br> </br>
   value-free   or   descriptive   general   theory   .   We   do   find   an   awareness   ,   not   apparent   in   Bentham   and   Austin   ,   that   point   or   function   is   intrinsic   to   the   <br> </br>
   constitution   ,   and   hence   to   the   descriptive   understanding   ,   of   the   subjectmatter   .   So   Kelsen   defines   law   as   a   specific   social   technique   :   ‘   the   social   <br> </br>
   technique   which   consists   in   bringing   about   the   desired   social   conduct   of   men   through   the   threat   of   a   measure   of   coercion   which   is   to   be   applied   in   case   of   <br> </br>
   contrary   conduct’.4   From   this   he   derives   his   characterization   of   the   individual   legal   norm   as   a   norm   for   the   application   of   a   sanction   ,   and   from   this   in   <br> </br>
