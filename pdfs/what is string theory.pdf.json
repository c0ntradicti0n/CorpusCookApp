Then, as now, one had a good technical control over the perturbation theory but little else. Wilson saw himself as asking the question \u201cWhat is quantum field theory?\u201d I found it enjoyable and inspiring to read about the various models he studied and approximations he tried (he refers to \u201cclutching at straws\u201d) before he found the simple and powerful answer, that the theory is to be organized scale-by-scale rather than graph-by-graph. That understanding made it possible to answer both problems of principle, such as how quantum field theory is to be defined beyond perturbation theory, and practical problems, such as how to determine the ground states and phases of quantum field theories. In string theory today we have these same kinds of problems, and I think there is good reason to expect that an equally powerful organizing principle remains to be found. There are many reasons, as I will touch upon later, to believe that string theory is the correct unification of gravity, quantum mechanics, and particle physics. It is implicit, then, that the theory actually exists, and \u2018exists\u2019 does not mean just perturbation theory. The nature of the organizing principle is at this point quite open, and may be very different from what we are used to in quantum field theory. One can ask whether the situation today in string theory is really as favorable as it was for field theory in the early 60\u2019s. It is difficult to know. Then, of course, we had many more experiments to tell us how quantum field theories actually behave. To offset that, we have today more experience and greater mathematical sophistication. As an optimist, I make an encouraging interpretation of the history, that many of the key advances in field theory\u2014Wilson\u2019s renormalization group, the discovery of spontaneously broken gauge symmetry as the theory of the electroweak interaction, the discovery of general relativity itself\u2014were carried out largely by study of simple model systems and limiting behaviors, and by considerations of internal consistency. These same tools are available in string theory today. My lectures divide into two parts\u2014an introduction to string theory as we now under- stand it, and a look at attempts to go further. For the introduction, I obviously cannot in five lectures cover the whole of superstring theory. Given time limitations, and given the broad range of interests among the students, I will try to focus on general principles. I will begin with conformal field theory (2.5 lectures), which of course has condensed mat- ter applications as well as being the central tool in string theory. Section 2 (2.5 lectures) introduces string theory itself. Section 3 (1 lecture), on dualities and equivalences, covers 4 the steadily increasing evidence that what appear to be different string theories are in many cases different ground states of a single theory. Section 4 (1 lecture) addresses the question of whether \u2018string field theory\u2019 is the organizing principle we seek. In section 5 (2 lectures) I discuss matrix models, exactly solvable string theories in low spacetime dimensions. I should emphasize that this is a survey of many subjects rather than a review of any single subject (for example R-duality, on which I spend half a lecture, was the subject of a recent review [2] with nearly 300 references). I made an effort to choose references which will be useful to the student\u2014a combination of reviews, some original references, and some interesting recent papers. 1 Conformal Field Theory Much of the material in this lecture, especially the first part, is standard and can be found in many reviews. The 1988 Les Houches lectures by Ginsparg [3] and Cardy [4] focus on conformal field theory, the latter with emphasis on applications in statistical mechanics. Introductions to string theory with emphasis on conformal field theory can be found in refs. [5]-[9]. There are a number of recent books on string theory, though often with less emphasis on conformal techniques [10]-[14] as well as a book [15] and reprint collection [16] on conformal field theory and statistical mechanics. Those who are in no great hurry will eventually find an expanded version of these lectures in ref. [17]. Finally I should mention the seminal papers [18] and [19]. 1.1 The Operator Product Expansion The operator product expansion (OPE) plays a central role in this subject. I will introduce it using the example of a free scalar field in two dimensions, X(\u03c31, \u03c32). I will focus on two dimensions because this is the case that will be of interest for the string, and I will refer to these two dimensions as \u2018space\u2019 though later they will be the string world-sheet and space will be something else. The action is 8\u03c0 \u222b\nd2\u03c3 {\n(\u22021X) The normalization of the field X (and so the action) is for later convenience. To be specific I have taken two Euclidean dimensions, but almost everything, at least until we get to 5 nontrivial topologies, can be continued immediately to the Minkowski case1 \u03c32 \u2192 \u2212i\u03c30.\nExpectation values are defined by the functional integral where F [X] is any functional of X, such as a product of local operators.2 It is very convenient to adopt complex coordinates Define also \u2202z =\n1 2\n(\u22021 \u2212 i\u22022), \u2202z\u0304 = 1 These have the properties \u2202zz = 1, \u2202z z\u0304 = 0, and so on. Note also that d\n2z = 2d\u03c31d\u03c32 from the Jacobian, and that\n\u222b\nd2z \u03b42(z, z\u0304) = 1. I will further abbreviate \u2202z to \u2202 and \u2202z\u0304 to \u2202\u0304 when this will not be ambiguous. For a general vector, define as above 2\n(v1 \u2212 iv2), vz\u0304 = 1 For the indices 1, 2 the metric is the identity and we do not distinguish between upper and lower, while the complex indices are raised and lowered with3 gzz\u0304 = gz\u0304z =\n1 2\n, gzz = gz\u0304z\u0304 = 0, g The action is then 4\u03c0 and the equation of motion is The notation X(z, z\u0304) may seem redundant, since the value of z determines the value of z\u0304, but it is useful to reserve the notation f(z) for fields whose equation of motion makes them\n1Both the Euclidean and Minkowski cases should be familiar to the condensed matter audience. The former would be relevant to classical critical phenomena in two dimensions, and the latter to quantum\ncritical phenomena in one dimension. 2Notice that this has not been normalized by dividing by < 1 >.\n3A comment on notation: being careful to keep the Jacobian, one has d2z = 2d\u03c31d\u03c32 and d2z \u221a\n| det g| = d\u03c31d\u03c32. However, in the literature one very frequently finds d2z used to mean d\u03c31d\u03c32. 6 analytic in z. For example, it follows at once from the equation of motion (1.1.8) that \u2202X is analytic and that \u2202\u0304X is antianalytic (analytic in z\u0304), hence the notations \u2202X(z) and \u2202\u0304X(z\u0304). Notice that under the Minkowski continuation, an analytic field becomes left-moving, a function only of \u03c30 + \u03c31, while an antianalytic field becomes right-moving, a function only of \u03c30 \u2212 \u03c31. Now, using the property of path integrals that the integral of a total derivative is zero, we have 0 =\n\u222b [dX]\n\u03b4 \u03b4X(z, z\u0304) {\ne\u2212SX(z\u2032, z\u0304\u2032) } =\n\u222b \u2032, z\u0304\u2032)\n} That is, the equation of motion holds except at coincident points. Now, the same calculation goes through if we have arbitrary additional insertions \u2018. . .\u2019 in the path integral, as long as no other fields are at (z, z\u0304) or (z\u2032, z\u0304\u2032): 1 A relation which holds in this sense will simply be written 1 and will be called an operator equation. One can think of the additional fields \u2018. . .\u2019 as preparing arbitrary initial and final states, so if one cuts the path integral open to make an Hamiltonian description, an operator equation is simply one which holds for arbitrary matrix elements. Note also that because of the way the path integral is constructed from iterated time slices, any product of fields in the path integral goes over to a time-ordered product in the Hamiltonian form. In the Hamiltonian formalism, the delta-function in eq. (1.1.11) comes from the differentiation of the time-ordering. Now we define a very useful combinatorial tool, normal ordering: 7 The logarithm satisfies the equation of motion (1.1.11) with the opposite sign (the action was normalized such that this log would have coefficient 1), so that by construction That is, the normal ordered product satisfies the naive equation of motion. This implies that the normal ordered product is locally the sum of an analytic and antianalytic function (a standard result from complex analysis). Thus it can be Taylor expanded, and so from the definition (1.1.12) we have (putting one operator at the origin for convenience) This is an operator equation, in the same sense as the preceding equations. Eq. (1.1.14) is our first example of an operator product expansion. For a general expec- tation value involving X(z, z\u0304)X(0, 0) and other fields, it gives the small-z behavior as a sum of terms, each of which is a known function of z times the expectation values of a single local operator. For a general field theory, denote a complete set of local operators for a field theory by Ai. The OPE then takes the general form k Later in section 1 I will give a simple derivation of the OPE (1.1.15), and of a rather broad generalization of it. OPE\u2019s are frequently used in particle and condensed matter physics as asymptotic expansions, the first few terms giving the dominant behavior at small z. However, I will argue that, at least in conformally invariant theories, the OPE is actually a convergent series. The radius of convergence is given by the distance to the nearest other operator in the path integral. Because of this the coefficient functions ckij(z, z\u0304), which as we will see must satisfy various further conditions, will enable us to reconstruct the entire field theory. sum over all Wick contractions with the propagator \u2212 ln |zi\u2212zj|2. Compare the asymptotics\nas z1 \u2192 z2 from the OPE (1.1.14) with the asymptotics of the exact expression. Verify that\nthe expansion in z1 \u2212 z2 has the stated radius of convergence. 4To be precise, expectation values of X(z, z\u0304) generally suffer from an infrared divergence on the plane.\nThis is a distraction which we ignore by some implicit long-distance regulator. In practice one is always\ninterested in \u2018good\u2019 operators such as derivatives or exponentials of X, which have well-defined expectation\nvalues. 8 The various operators on the right-hand side of the OPE (1.1.14) involve products of fields at the same point. Usually in quantum field theory such a product is divergent and must be appropriately cut off and renormalized, but here the normal ordering renders it well-defined. Normal ordering is thus a convenient way to define composite operators in free field theory. It is of little use in most interacting field theories, because these have additional divergences from interaction vertices approaching the composite operator or one another. But many of the conformal field theories that we will be interested in are free, and many others can be related to free field theories, so it will be worthwhile to develop normal ordering somewhat further. For products of more than 2 fields the definition (1.1.12) can be extended iteratively, +\n{ contracting each pair (omitting the pair and subtracting \u2212 ln |z \u2212 zi|2). This has the same\nproperties as before: the equation of motion holds inside the normal ordering, and so the normal-ordered product is smooth. (Exercise: Show this. The simplest argument I have found is inductive, and uses the definition twice to pull both X(z, z\u0304) and X(z1, z\u03041) out of the normal ordering.) The definition (1.1.16) can be written more formally as for an arbitrary functional F [X], the integral over the functional derivative producing all\ncontractions. Finally, the definition of normal ordering can be written in a closed form by the same strategy, 1 2 \u03b4X(z, z\u0304) \u03b4 \u03b4X(z\u2032, z\u0304\u2032) The exponential sums over all ways of contracting zero, one, two, or more pairs. The operator product of two normal ordered operators can be represented compactly as \u03b4X(z\u2032, z\u0304\u2032) 9 where \u03b4F and \u03b4G act only on the fields in F and G respectively. The expressions :F [X] : :G[X] :\nand :F [X]G[X] : differ by the contractions between one field from F and one field from G,\nwhich are then restored by the exponential. Now, for F a local operator at z1 and G a local\noperator at z2, we can expand in z1\u2212 z2 inside the normal ordering on the right to generate\nthe OPE. For example, one finds since each contraction gives k1k2 ln |z|2 and the contractions exponentiate. Exponential op-\nerators will be quite useful to us. Another example is coming from a single contraction. 1.2 Ward Identities The action (1.1.7) has a number of important symmetries, in particular conformal invariance. Let us first derive the Ward identities for a general symmetry. Suppose we have fields \u03c6\u03b1(\u03c3) with some action S[\u03c6], and a symmetry That is, the product of the path integral measure and the weight e\u2212S is invariant. For a path integral with general insertion F [\u03c6], make the change of variables (1.2.1). The invariance of\nthe integral under change of variables, and the invariance of the measure times e\u2212S , give 0 =\n\u222b\nd2\u03c3 \u2211 \u03b1 < \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1(\u03c3)\n\u03b4 This simply states that the general expectation value is invariant under the symmetry. We can derive additional information from the symmetry: the existence of a conserved current (Noether\u2019s theorem), and Ward identities for the expectation values of the current. Consider the following change of variables, 10 This is not a symmetry, the transformation law being altered by the inclusion of an arbitrary function \u03c1(\u03c3). The path integral measure times e\u2212S would be invariant if \u03c1 were a constant, so its variation must be proportional to the gradient \u2202a\u03c1. Making the change of variables (1.2.3) in the path integral thus gives 0 =\n\u222b [d\u03c6\u2032] e\u2212S[\u03c6\n\u2032 ] \u2212 \u222b\n[d\u03c6] e\u2212S[\u03c6] =\ni\ufffd 2\u03c0 \u222b\n[d\u03c6] e\u2212S[\u03c6] The unknown coefficient ja(\u03c3) comes from the variation of the measure and the action, both of which are local, and so it must be a local function of the fields and their derivatives. Taking the function \u03c1 to be nonzero only in a small region allows us to integrate by parts; also, the identity (1.2.4) remains valid if we add arbitrary distant insertions \u2018. . .\u2019.5 We thus derive as an operator equation. This is Noether\u2019s theorem. Exercise: Use this to derive the classical Noether theorem in the form usually found in textbooks. That is, assume that S[\u03c6] =\n\u222b\nd2\u03c3 L(\u03c6(\u03c3), \u2202a\u03c6(\u03c3)) and ignore the variation of the measure. Invariance of the action implies that the variation of the Lagrangian density is a total derivative, \u03b4L = \ufffd\u2202\u00b5K\n\u00b5 under a symmetry transformation (1.2.1). Then the classical result is j\u00b5 = 2\u03c0i (\n\u2202L The extra factor of 2\u03c0i is conventional in conformal field theory. The derivation we have given is the quantum version of Noether\u2019s theorem, and assumes that the path integral can in fact be defined in a way consistent with the symmetry. Now to derive the Ward identity, take any closed contour C, and let \u03c1(\u03c3) = 1 inside C and 0 outside C. Also, include in the path integral some general local operator A(z0, z\u03040) at a\npoint z0 inside C, and the usual distant insertions \u2018. . .\u2019. Proceeding as above we obtain the operator relation 1 2\u03c0 \u222e 5Our convention is that \u2018. . .\u2019 refers to distant insertions used to prepare a general initial and final state\nbut which otherwise play no role, while F is a general insertion in the region of interest. 11 This relates the integral of the current around any operator to the variation of the operator. In complex coordinates, the left-hand side is 1 2\u03c0i \u222e where the contour runs counterclockwise and we abbreviate jz to j and jz\u0304 to j\u0304. Finally, in conformal field theory it is usually the case that j is analytic and j\u0304 antianalytic, except for singularities at the other fields, so that the integral (1.2.8) just picks out the residues. Thus, Here \u2018Res\u2019 and \u2018Res\u2019 pick out the coefficients of (z \u2212 z0)\u22121 and (z\u0304 \u2212 z\u03040)\u22121 respectively. This\nform of the Ward identity is particularly convenient in CFT. It is important to note that Noether\u2019s theorem and the Ward identity are local properties that do not depend on whatever boundary conditions we might have far away, not even whether the latter are invariant under the symmetry. In particular, since the function \u03c1(\u03c3) is nonzero only in the interior of C, the symmetry transformation need only be defined there. 1.3 Conformal Invariance Systems at a critical point are invariant under overall rescalings of space, z \u2192 z \u2032 = az; if the\nsystem is also rotationally invariant, a can be complex. These transformations rescale the metric, ds2 = d\u03c3ad\u03c3a = dzdz\u0304 \u2192 dz\u2032dz\u0304\u2032 = |a|2ds2. (1.3.1)\nUnder fairly broad conditions, a scale invariant system will also be invariant under the larger symmetry of conformal transformations, which also will play a central role in string theory. These are transformations z \u2192 z\u2032(z, z\u0304) which rescale the metric by a position-dependent\nfactor: ds2 \u2192 \u21262(z, z\u0304)ds2. (1.3.2)\nSuch a transformation will leave invariant ratios of lengths of infinitesimal vectors located at the same point, and so also angles between them. In complex coordinates, it is easy to see that this requires that z\u2032 be an analytic function of z,6 z\u2032 = f(z), z\u0304\u2032 = f\u0304(z\u0304). (1.3.3)\n6A antianalytic function z\u2032 = f(z\u0304) also works, but changes the orientation. In most string theories, including the ones of greatest interest, the orientation is fixed. 12 A theory with this invariance is termed a conformal field theory (CFT). The free action (1.1.7) is conformally invariant with X transforming as a scalar, the transformation of d2z offsetting that of the derivatives. For an infinitesimal transforma- tion, z\u2032 = z + \ufffdg(z), we have \u03b4X = \u2212g(z)\u2202X \u2212 g\u0304(z\u0304)\u2202\u0304X, and Noether\u2019s theorem gives the\ncurrent where7 Because g(z) and g\u0304(z\u0304) are linearly independent, both terms in the divergence \u2202\u0304j \u2212 \u2202j\u0304 must\nvanish independently, as is indeed the case. The Noether current for a rigid translation is the energy-momentum tensor, ja = iTab\u03b4\u03c3\nb (the i from CFT conventions), so we have With the vanishing of Tzz\u0304 = Tz\u0304z, the conservation law \u2202aT\na\nb = 0 implies that Tzz is analytic and Tz\u0304z\u0304 is antianalytic; this is a general result in CFT. By the way, Tzz and Tz\u0304z\u0304 are in no sense conjugate to one another (we will see, for example, that in they act on completely different sets of oscillator modes), so I use a tilde rather than a bar on T\u0303 . The transformation of X, with the Ward identity (1.2.9), implies the operator product 1 This is readily verified from the specific form (1.3.6), and one could have used it to derive the form of T . 7Many students asked why T automatically came out normal-ordered. The answer is simply that in this\nparticular case all ways of defining the product (at least all rotationally invariant renormalizations) give the\nsame result; they could differ at most by a constant, but this must be zero because T transforms by a phase\nunder rotations. It was also asked how one knows that the measure is conformally invariant; this is evident\na posteriori because the conformal current is indeed conserved. 13 For a general operator A, the variation under rigid translation is just \u2212\u03b4\u03c3a\u2202aA, which de-\ntermines the 1/z term in the TA OPE. We usually deal with operators which are eigenstates\nof the rigid rescaling plus rotation z\u2032 = az: The (h, h\u0303) are the weights of A. The sum h + h\u0303 is the dimension of A, determining its\nbehavior under scaling, while h \u2212 h\u0303 is the spin, determining its behavior under rotations.\nThe Ward identity then gives part of the OPE, and similarly for T\u0303 . A special case is a tensor or primary operator O, which transforms\nunder general conformal transformations as This is equivalent to the OPE the more singular terms in the general OPE (1.3.11) being absent. In the free X CFT, one tensor of weight 1\n2\nk2, while \u22022X has weight (2, 0) but is not a tensor. For the energy-momentum tensor with itself one finds for the free X theory 2z4\n+ 2 1 and similarly for T\u0303 ,8 so this is not a tensor. Rather, the OPE (1.3.14) implies the transfor- mation law 8One easily sees that the T T\u0303 OPE is analytic. By the way, unless otherwise stated OPE\u2019s hold only at\nnon-zero separation, ignoring possible delta functions. For all of the applications we will have the latter do\nnot matter. Occasionally it is useful to include the delta functions, but in general these depend partly on\ndefinitions so one must be careful. 14 More generally, the TT OPE in any CFT is of the form 2z4\n+ 2 1 with c a constant known as the central charge. The central charge of a free boson is 1; for D free bosons it is D. The finite form of the transformation law (1.3.15) is c where {f, z} denotes the Schwarzian derivative, The corresponding form holds for T\u0303 , possibly with a different central charge c\u0303. 1.4 Mode Expansions For an analytic or antianalytic operator we can make a Laurent expansion, T (z) =\n\u221e\u2211 m=\u2212\u221e Lm\nzm+2 , T\u0303 (z\u0304) =\n\u221e\u2211 m=\u2212\u221e L\u0303m\nz\u0304m+2 The Laurent coefficients, known as the Virasoro generators, are given by the contour integrals Lm =\n\u222e C dz \u222e C dz\u0304 where C is any contour encircling the origin. This expansion has a simple and important interpretation [20]. Defining any monotonic time variable, one can slice open a path integral along the constant-time curves to recover a Hamiltonian description. In particular, let \u2018time\u2019 be ln |z|, running radially outward from z = 0. This may seem odd, but is quite natural\nin CFT\u2014in terms of the conformally equivalent coordinate w defined z = e\u2212iw, an annular region around z = 0 becomes a cylinder, with Im(w) being the time and Re(w) being a spatial coordinate with periodicity 2\u03c0. Thus, the radial time slicing is equivalent to quantizing the CFT on a finite periodic space; this is what will eventually be interpreted as the quantization of a closed string. The \u2018+2\u2019s in the exponents (1.4.1) come from the conformal transformation 15 z=0 z2 a) b) Figure 1: a) Contours centered on z = 0. b) For given z2 on contour C2, contour C1 \u2212C3 is\ncontracted. of T , so that in the w frame m just denotes the Fourier mode; for an analytic field of weight h this becomes \u2018+h\u2019. In the Hamiltonian form, the Virasoro generators become operators in the ordinary sense. Since by analyticity the integrals (1.4.2) are independent of C, they are actually conserved charges, the charges associated with the conformal transformations. It is an important fact that the OPE of currents determines the algebra of the corresponding charges. Consider charges Qi, i = 1, 2: Qi{C} =\n\u222e C dz Then we have The charges on the left are defined by the contours shown in fig. 1a; when we slice open the path integral, operators are time-ordered, so the difference of contours generates the commutator. Now, for a given point z2 on the contour C2, we can deform the difference of the C1 and C3 contours as shown in fig. 1b, with the result C2 dz2\n2\u03c0i 16 Applying this to the Virasoro generators gives the Virasoro algebra, The L\u0303m satisfy the same algebra with central charge c\u0303. For the Laurent coefficients of an analytic tensor field O of weight (h, 0), one finds from the OPE (1.3.13) the commutator Note that commutation with L0 is diagonal and proportional to \u2212n. Modes On for n > 0\nreduce L0 and are termed lowering operators, while modes On for n < 0 increase L0 and are\ntermed raising operators. From the OPE (1.3.13) and the definitions, we see that a tensor operator is annihilated by all the lowering operators,9 For an arbitrary operator, it follows from the OPE (1.3.11) that Note that L0 + L\u03030 is the generator of scale transformations, or in other words of radial time translations. It differs from the Hamiltonian H of the cylindrical w coordinate system by an additive constant from the non-tensor behavior of T , Similarly, L0\u2212 L\u03030 measures the spin, and is equal to the spatial translation generator in the\nw frame, up to an additive constant. For the free X CFT, the Noether current of translations is (i\u2202X(z), i\u2202\u0304X(z\u0304)). Again, the components are separately analytic and antianalytic, which signifies the existence of an enlarged symmetry X \u2192 X + y(z) + y\u0304(z\u0304). Define the modes i\u2202X(z) =\n\u221e\u2211 m=\u2212\u221e \u03b1m\nzm+1 , i\u2202\u0304X(z\u0304) =\n\u221e\u2211 m=\u2212\u221e \u03b1\u0303m\nz\u0304m+1 9Often one deals with different copies of the Virasoro algebra defined by Laurent expansions in different\ncoordinates z, so I like to put a \u2018\u00b7\u2019 between the generator and the operator as a reminder that the generators\nare defined in the coordinate centered on the operator. 17 From the OPE we have the algebra and the same for \u03b1\u0303m. As expected for a free field, this is a harmonic oscillator algebra for each mode; in terms of the usual raising and lowering operators \u03b1m \u223c\n\u221a\nma, \u03b1\u2212m \u223c \u221a\nma\u2020. To generate the whole spectrum we start from a state |0, k\u3009 which is annihilated by the\nm > 0 operators and is an eigenvector of the m = 0 operators, The rest of the spectrum is generated by the raising operators \u03b1m and \u03b1\u0303m for m < 0. Note that the eigenvalues of \u03b10 and \u03b1\u03030 must be equal because X is single valued,\n\u222e (dz \u2202X + dz\u0304 \u2202\u0304X) = 0; later we will relax this. Inserting the expansion (1.4.11) into T (z) and comparing with the Laurent expansion gives Lm \u223c\n1 2 n=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b1n\u03b1m\u2212n. (1.4.15) However, we must be careful about operator ordering. The Virasoro generators were defined in terms of the normal ordering (1.1.12), while for the mode expansion it is most convenient to use a different ordering, in which all raising operators are to the left of the lowering operators. Both of these procedures are generally referred to as normal ordering, but they are in general different, so we might refer to the first as \u2018conformal normal ordering\u2019 and the latter as \u2018creation-annihilation normal ordering.\u2019 Since conformal normal order is our usual method, we will simply refer to it as normal ordering. We could develop a dictionary between these, but there are several ways to take a short-cut. Only for m = 0 do non-commuting operators appear together, so we must have 2\n\u03b120 + n=1 \u03b1\u2212n\u03b1n +A Lm =\n1 2 for some constant A. Now use the Virasoro algebra as follows 18 All terms on the left have \u03b1m with m \u2265 0 acting on |0, 0\u3009 and so must vanish; thus, Thus, a general state has 1 where the levels L, L\u0303 are the total oscillator excitation numbers, One needs to calculate the normal ordering constant A often, so the following heuristic- but-correct rules are useful: 1. Add the zero point energies, 1\n2\n\u03c9 for each bosonic mode and \u2212 1 2\n\u03c9 for each fermionic. 2. One encounters divergent sums of the form\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1(n\u2212 \u03b8), the \u03b8 arising when one considers nontrivial periodicity conditions. Define this to be n=1 I will not try to justify this, but it is the value given by any conformally invariant renormal- ization. 3. The above is correct in the cylindrical w coordinate, but for L0 we must add the non- tensor correction c/24. For the free boson, the modes are integer so we get one-half of the sum (1.4.22) for \u03b8 = 0, that is \u2212 1\n24 , after step 2. This is just offset by the correction in step 3. The zero-point sum in step 2 is a Casimir energy, from the finite spatial size. For a system of physical size l we must scale H by 2\u03c0/l, giving (including the left-movers) the correct Casimir energy \u2212\u03c0/6l.\nFor antiperiodic scalars one gets the sum with \u03b8 = 1 2\nand Casimir energy \u03c0/12l. To get the mode expansion for X, integrate the Laurent expansions (1.4.11). Define first m6=0 \u03b1m\nmzm m6=0 \u03b1\u0303m\nmz\u0304m 19 with These give Actually, these only hold modulo i\u03c0 as one can check, but we will not dwell on this.10 In any case we are for the present only interested in the sum, for which the OPE X(z, z\u0304)X(0, 0) \u223c \u2212 ln |z|2 is unambiguous. 1.5 States and Operators Radial quantization gives rise to a natural isomorphism between the state space of the CFT, in a periodic spatial dimension, and the space of local operators. Consider the path integral with a local operator A at the origin, no other operators inside the unit circle |z| = 1, and\nunspecified operators and boundary conditions outside. Cutting open the path integral on the unit circle represents the path integral as an inner product \u3008\u03c8out|\u03c8in\u3009, where |\u03c8in\u3009 is the\nincoming state produced by the path integral at |z| < 1 and |\u03c8out\u3009 is the outgoing state\nproduced by the path integral at |z| > 1. More explicitly, separate the path integral over\nfields \u03c6 into an integral over the fields outside the circle, inside the circle, and on the circle itself; call these last \u03c6B. The outside integral produces a result \u03c8out(\u03c6B), and the inside integral a result \u03c8in(\u03c6B), leaving The incoming state depends on A, so we denote it more explicitly as |\u03c8A\u3009. This is the\nmapping from operators to states. That is, integrating over the fields on the unit disk, with fixed boundary values \u03c6B and with an operator A at the origin, produces a result \u03c8A(\u03c6B),\nwhich is a state in the Schrodinger representation. The mapping from operators to states is given by the path integral on the unit disk. To see the inverse, take a state |\u03c8\u3009 to be an\neigenstate of L0 and L\u03030. Since L0 + L\u03030 is the radial Hamiltonian, inserting |\u03c8\u3009 on the unit 10But it means that one sometimes need to introduce \u2018cocycles\u2019 to fix the phases of exponential operators. 20 Q\nQ \u03c8 A a) b) A Figure 2: a) World-sheet (shaded) with state |\u03c8A\u3009 on the boundary circle, acted upon by\nQ. b) Equivalent picture: the unit disk with operator A has been sewn in along the dotted\nline, and Q contracted around the operator. circle is equivalent to inserting r\u2212L0\u2212L\u03030 |\u03c8\u3009 on a circle of radius r. Taking r to be infinitesimal\ndefines a local operator which is equivalent to |\u03c8\u3009 on the unit circle.\nExercise: This all sounds a bit abstract, so here is a calculation one can do explicitly. The ground state of the free scalar is e\u2212\n\u2211\u221e m=1\nmXmX\u2212m/2, where Xm are the Fourier modes of X on the circle. Derive this by canonical quantization of the modes, writing them in terms of Xm and \u2202/\u2202Xm. Obtain it also by evaluating the path integral on the unit disk with X fixed on the boundary and no operator insertions. Thus the ground state corresponds to the unit operator. Usually one does not actually evaluate a path integral as above, but uses indirect argu- ments. Note that if Q is any conserved charge, the state Q|\u03c8A\u3009 corresponds to the operator\nQ \u00b7A, as shown in fig. 2. Now, in the free theory consider the case that A is the unit operator\nand let Q = \u03b1m =\n\u222e C dz With no operators inside the disk, \u2202X is analytic and the integral vanishes for m \u2265 0. Thus,\n\u03b1m|\u03c81\u3009 = 0, m \u2265 0, which establishes 21 as found directly in the exercise. Proceeding as above one finds and for the raising operators, evaluating the contour integral (1.5.2) for m < 0 gives i\n1 and in parallel for the tilded modes. That is, the state obtained by acting with raising oper- ators on (1.5.4) is given by the product of the exponential with the corresponding derivatives of X; the product automatically comes out normal ordered. The state corresponding to a tensor field O satisfies This is known as a highest weight or primary state. For almost all purposes one is interested in highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, built by acting on a given highest weight state with the Lm, m < 0. The state-operator mapping gives a simple derivation of the OPE, shown in fig. 3. Consider the product Ai(z, z\u0304)Aj(0, 0), |z| < 1. Integrating the fields inside the unit cir-\ncle generates a state on the unit circle, which we might call |\u03c8ij,z,z\u0304\u3009. Expand in a complete\nset, |\u03c8ij,z,z\u0304\u3009 =\n\u2211 k ckij(z, z\u0304)|\u03c8k\u3009. (1.5.7) Finally use the mapping to replace |\u03c8k\u3009 on the unit circle with Ak at the origin, giving\nthe general OPE (1.1.15). The claimed convergence is just the usual convergence of a com- plete set in quantum mechanics. The construction is possible as long as there are no other operators with |z\u2032| \u2264 |z|, so that we can cut on a circle of radius |z|+ \ufffd. Incidentally, applying a rigid rotation and scaling to both sides of the general OPE determines the z-dependence of the coefficient functions, k zhk\u2212hi\u2212hj z\u0304h\u0303k\u2212h\u0303i\u2212h\u0303jckijAk(0, 0). (1.5.8) From the full conformal symmetry one learns much more: all the ckij are determined in terms of those of the primary fields. 22 \u03c8 A a) b) A c) A i j (0,0) (z,z) ij,z,z ij,z,z Figure 3: a) World-sheet with two local operators. b) Integration over fields on the interior\nof the disk produces boundary state |\u03c8ij,z,z\u0304\u3009. c) Sewing in a disk with the corresponding\nlocal operator. Expanding in operators of definite weight gives the OPE. For three operators, Ai(0)Aj(1)Ak(z), the regions of convergence of the z \u2192 0 and z \u2192 1\nOPE\u2019s (|z| < 1 and |1\u2212 z| < 1) overlap. The coefficient of Am in the triple product can then\nbe written as a sum involving clikc m\nlj or as a sum involving c l\njkc m\nli. Associativity requires these sums to be equal; this is represented schematically in fig. 4. A unitary CFT is one that has a positive inner product \u3008\u3008 | \u3009; the double bracket is to\ndistinguish it from a different inner product to be defined later. Also, it is required that 23 \u03a3\ni k j m l =\nl \u03a3 k j mi l l Figure 4: Schematic picture of OPE associativity. and \u03b1\u2020m = \u03b1\u2212m, \u03b1\u0303\n\u2020\nm = \u03b1\u0303\u2212m; this implicitly defines the inner product of all higher states. Unitary CFT\u2019s are highly constrained; I will derive here a few of the basic results, and mention others later. The first constraint is that any state in a unitary highest weight representation must have h, h\u0303 \u2265 0. Consider first the highest weight state itself, |O\u3009. The Virasoro algebra gives so hO \u2265 0. All other states in the representation, obtained by acting with the raising\ngenerators, have higher weight so the result follows. It also follows that if hO = 0 then L\u22121 \u00b7 O = L\u0303\u22121 \u00b7 O. The relation (1.4.9) thus implies that O is independent of position;\ngeneral principle of quantum field theory then require O to be a c-number. That is, the unit\noperator is the only (0,0) operator. In a similar way, one finds that an operator in a unitary CFT is analytic if and only if h\u0303 = 0, and antianalytic if and only if h = 0. 24 1.6 Other CFT\u2019s Now we describe briefly several other CFT\u2019s of interest. The first is given by the same action (1.1.7) as the earlier X theory, but with energy-momentum tensor [21] Q The TT operator product is still of the general form (1.3.16), but now has central charge Exponentials : eikX : are still tensors, but with weight 1\n2\n(k2 + ikQ). One notable change is in the state-operator mapping. The translation current j = i\u2202X is no longer a tensor, \u03b4j = \u2212g\u2202j \u2212 j\u2202g \u2212 iQ\u22022g/2. The finite form is11 \u2032) = jz(z)\u2212\niQ 2 \u22022zz\n\u2032 Applied to the cylinder frame z\u2032 = w = i ln z this gives 1 2\u03c0i \u222b\ndw jw = \u03b10 + iQ Thus a state |0, k\u3009 which whose canonical momentum (defined on the left) is k corresponds\nto the operator Note that i\u03b10 just picks out the exponent of the operator, so \u03b10 = k \u2212 iQ/2. The mode expansion of the m 6= 0 generators is Lm =\n1 2 n=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b1n\u03b1m\u2212n + iQ 11To derive this, and the finite transformation (1.3.17) of T , you can first write the most general form\nwhich has the correct infinitesimal limit and is appropriately homogeneous in z and z \u2032 indices, and fix the\nfew resulting constants by requiring proper composition under z \u2192 z \u2032 \u2192 z\u2032\u2032. 25 the last term coming from the \u22022X term in T . For m = 0 the result is 8\n+\n\u221e\u2211 n=1 \u03b1\u00b5\u2212n\u03b1\u00b5,n =\n1 2\nk2 + Q2 8\n+\n\u221e\u2211 n=1 \u03b1\u00b5\u2212n\u03b1\u00b5,n. (1.6.7) The constant in the first line can be obtained from the z\u22122 term in the OPE of T with the\nvertex operator (1.6.5); this is a quick way to derive or to check normal-ordering constants. In the second line, expressed in terms of the \u2018canonical\u2019 momentum k it agrees with our heuristic rules. This CFT has a number of applications in string theory, some of which we will encounter. Let me also mention a slight variation, :\u2202X\u2202X : + i\n\u03ba 2\n: \u2202\u0304X\u2202\u0304X : \u2212 i\u03ba with central charge c = 1 \u2212 3\u03ba2. With the earlier transformation (1.6.2), the variation of\nX contains a constant piece under rigid scale transformations (g a real constant). In other words, one can regard X as the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale invariance. For the theory (1.6.8), the variation of X contains a constant piece under rigid rotations (g an imaginary constant), and X is the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken rotational invariance. This is not directly relevant to string theory (the i in the energy-momentum tensor makes the theory non-unitary) but occurs for real membranes (where the unitarity condition is not relevant because both dimensions are spatial). In particular the CFT (1.6.8) describes hexatic membranes,12 in which the rotational symmetry is broken to Z6. The unbroken discrete symmetry plays an indirect role in forbidding certain nonlinear couplings between the Goldstone boson X and the membrane coordinates. Another simple variation on the free boson is to make it periodic, but we leave this until section 3 where we will discuss some interesting features. Another family of free CFT\u2019s involves two anticommuting fields with action 2\u03c0 \u222b\nd2z {b\u2202\u0304c + b\u0303\u2202c\u0303}. (1.6.9) 12I would like to thank Mark Bowick and Phil Nelson for educating me on this subject. 26 The equations of motion are so the fields are respectively analytic and antianalytic. The operator products are readily found as before, with appropriate attention to the order of anticommuting variables, z\n, b\u0303(z\u0304)c\u0303(0) \u223c 1 z\u0304\n, c\u0303(z\u0304)b\u0303(0) \u223c 1 We focus again on the analytic part; in fact the action (1.6.9) is a sum, and can be regarded as two independent CFT\u2019s. The action is conformally invariant if b is a (\u03bb, 0) tensor, and c a (1 \u2212 \u03bb, 0) tensor; by interchange of b and c we can assume \u03bb positive. The\ncorresponding energy-momentum tensor is One finds that the TT OPE has the usual form with The fields have the usual Laurent expansions b(z) =\n\u221e\u2211 m=\u2212\u221e bm\nzm+\u03bb , c(z) =\n\u221e\u2211 m=\u2212\u221e cm\nzm+1\u2212\u03bb giving rise to the anticommutator Also, {cm, cn} = {bm, bn} = 0. Because of the m = 0 modes there are two natural ground\nstates, | \u2191\u3009 and | \u2193\u3009. Both are annihilated by bm and cm for m > 0, while These are related | \u2191\u3009 = c0| \u2193\u3009, | \u2193\u3009 = b0| \u2191\u3009. With the antianalytic theory included, there are\nalso the zero modes b\u03030 and c\u03030 and so four ground states\u2014| \u2193\u2193\u3009, etc. 27 The Virasoro generators in terms of the modes are L0 =\n\u221e\u2211 n=1 n(b\u2212ncn + c\u2212nbn) \u2212\n\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 1) 2 Lm =\n\u221e\u2211 The ordering constant is found as before. Two sets (b and c) of integer anticommuting modes give 1\n12 at step 2, and the central charge correction then gives the result above. The state-operator mapping is a little tricky. Let \u03bb be an integer, so that the Laurent expansion (1.6.14) has no branch cut. For the unit operator the fields are analytic at the origin, so Thus, the unit state is in general not one of the ground states, but rather up to normalization. Also, we have the dictionary b\u2212m \u2194\n1 (m\u2212 \u03bb)!\u2202\nm\u2212\u03bbb, c\u2212m \u2194 1 Thus we have, taking the value \u03bb = 2 which will be relevant later, The bc theory has a conserved current j = : cb :, called ghost number, which counts the number of c\u2019s minus the number of b\u2019s. In the cylindrical w frame the vacua have average ghost number zero, so \u2212 1\n2 for | \u2193\u3009 and +1\n2 for | \u2191\u3009. The ghost numbers of the corresponding\noperators are \u03bb \u2212 1 and \u03bb, as we see from the example (1.6.21). As in the case of the\nmomentum (1.6.4), the difference arises because the current is not a tensor. For the special case \u03bb = 1\n2\n, b and c have the same weight and the bc system can be split in two in a conformall", "filename": "what is string theory.pdf", "meta": {"bla": "huahaua"}}
