{"text": "Kripke - Naming&Necessity   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes     Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  genesis and background of the leading ideas of the monograph, and discusses a  few common misunderstandings. Little space is devoted to the more substantial  shortcomings of the monograph (though Kripke stands by its major theses),  though in the preface, he explains further, in particular, the concepts of modality  and rigid designation. Those objections touched on are dealt with briefly as  constrained by the length of the preface \u2013 hopefully not so briefly as to confirm  some into thinking the objections cogent.   \u2022 The preface is not self-standing and should be read by new readers after the main  text, by way of background and clarification.     1.2 Historical Background    \u2022 When (prior to 1963) Kripke was working on the model theory of modal logic  (\u201cpossible worlds\u201d semantics), it had occurred to him, in agreement with Wiggins,  that the Leibnizian principle of the indiscernibility of identicals (ie. identicals have  all properties in common  (x)(y)(x = y & Fx .\u2283. Fy)  not to be confused with the  identity of indiscernibles) was as self-evident as the law of contradiction. Alleged  counter-examples involving modal properties always turned out to depend on a  confusion  non-genuine properties, confused scopes, coincidence between  individual concepts confused with identity between individuals1. Ignoring the fact  that x need not have necessary existence, Kripke says it\u2019s clear that identity is an  internal2 relation \u2013 ie. (x)(y) (x = y  \u2283 \ufffd x = y)  from (x) \ufffd (x = x) and Leibniz\u2019s  law. Kripke asks what pairs (x, y) could act as counter-examples, for if the objects  are distinct, the antecedent is false, while if they are the same, the consequent is  true. If it\u2019s true that \u201ca = b\u201d, then if \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d are rigid designators, it follows  that \u201ca = b\u201d is necessarily true, while if they are not rigid, no such conclusion  follows about the statement \u201ca = b\u201d, even though the objects designated by \u201ca\u201d  and \u201cb\u201d will be necessarily identical.   \u2022 As yet, we are not committed to any thesis about natural-language \u201cnames\u201d. We  must distinguish three things:i. That identical objects are necessarily identical  ii. That true identity statements between rigid designators are necessary  \u2018internal relation\u2019 has been used in different ways, but it is often used as the relational analogue of  an essential (monadic) property. For example, if a bears the relation R to b, then R internally  relates a to b just in case a bears this relation to b in every possible circumstance in which they  both exist. Relations that are not internal, that contingently link their relata (the things they relate),  are external. Bill and Hillary are married, but they might not have been, so this relation between  them is external. By contrast, some philosophers have suggested that the relation being a biological  parent of is an internal relation. In every world in which Bill and Chelsea both exist, Bill is her  father. If this is correct, then the relational property, being a child of Bill is essential to Chelsea,  but being the father of Chelsea is not essential to Bill (he and Hillary might never have met, in  which case they would not have had Chelsea)\u201d.   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  iii. That identity statements between what we call \u201cnames\u201d in actual language are  necessary.  \u2022 Kripke claims that (i) and (ii) are self-evident theses of philosophical logic  independent of natural language. They are related, but (i) is about objects, whereas  (ii) is metalinguistic, roughly following from (i) using substitution of rigid  designators for universal qualifiers (\u201croughly\u201d, because delicate distinctions about  rigidity are relevant, since the analogous deduction for non-rigid designators is  false).   \u2022 All that strictly follows from (ii) about \u201cnames\u201d in natural language is that either  they aren\u2019t rigid or true identities between them are necessary. Kripke thinks our  intuitive notion is that names are rigid, but he had been led astray to the contrary  belief by prevailing opinion and the fact that there are obviously contingent  identities between so-called names3. However, without investigating natural  language, it is already clear from (i) that the supposition popular amongst  materialists that objects can be \u201ccontingently identical\u201d is false4. Identity would be  an internal relation even if natural language had no rigid designators. Kripke  claims that this confused notion enabled philosophers simultaneously to think of  certain designators as though they were (1) non-rigid and (2) rigid  the conflict  being hidden by thinking of the corresponding objects as \u201ccontingently identical\u201d.  Kripke felt little sympathy for this \u201cdark doctrine\u201d \u2013 uniquely identifying  properties can coincide contingently, but objects cannot be contingently identical.  \u2022 In 1963-4, Kripke concluded that it can be demonstrated that names in ordinary  language are rigid designators, and therefore that identities are necessary. Also,  that any symbol in a natural or hypothetical language that is not a rigid designator  ought not to be called a name  this applies in particular to (names as) hypothetical  abbreviations of non-rigid definite descriptions. Kripke clarified matters by  distinguishing between using descriptions to give meaning and to fix reference.  Kripke, at this stage, rejected conventional description theory as an account of  meaning, but retained it momentarily as an account of fixing a reference. See the  Second Lecture, for the rejection of the description theory for fixing reference and  defining natural kinds.  \u2022 Kripke pays tribute to the power of the then prevailing ideas, stemming from  Frege and Russell5. He admits that the description theory of names has intuitive  appeal and much internal consistency, in contrast to much philosophising.     1.3 Names & Rigid Designation    \u2022 Kripke now gives a brief (and maybe unnecessary) restatement of the familiar idea  of rigid designation and the underlying intuition about names. We are asked to  consider the statement:-  (1) \u201cAristotle was fond of dogs\u201d  To understand this correctly, we need to understand both (a) the extensionally  correct conditions under which it is in fact true and (b) the conditions under which  it would partially correctly describe a counterfactual course of history.   \u2022 Kripke presumes that everyone agrees that there was a certain man \u2013 the  philosopher we call \u201cAristotle\u201d \u2013 such that (1) is true iff he was fond of dogs.  contingently identical to a brain-state.   5  But, doesn\u2019t Kripke have Frege and Russell wrong?   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  Even Russell would agree that this is simply material equivalence, given that there  really was an Aristotle. The thesis of rigid designation (ignoring subtleties such as  possible situations in which Aristotle would not have existed) is just that the same  paradigm applies to the truth conditions of (1) as applies to counterfactual  situations. (1) describes a counterfactual situation truly iff the aforementioned  man would have liked dogs had the counterfactual conditions applied (again  ignoring counterfactual situations where he wouldn\u2019t have existed).   \u2022 In contrast, Russell would have analysed (1) as something like:  (2) \u201cThe last great philosopher of antiquity was fond of dogs\u201d  which in turn should be analysed as:  (3) \u201cExactly one person was last amongst the great philosophers of antiquity,  and any such person was fond of dogs\u201d  \u2022 Kripke notes that the actual truth conditions of (3) agree with those of (1) \u2013  provided Aristotle was the last great philosopher of antiquity \u2013 but in  counterfactual situations wild divergences can occur between Russell\u2019s  explanation and the rigidity thesis. In counterfactual situations where someone  else was last great philosopher of antiquity, Russell\u2019s analysis would make that  other person\u2019s fondness for dogs the relevant issue in deciding the correctness of  (1).   \u2022 Kripke has a footnote where he says that he assumes Russell is right to say that  definite descriptions can sometimes be interpreted non-rigidly. Other philosophers  claim that definite descriptions can be interpreted rigidly, but Kripke doubts this.  However, he doesn\u2019t think his principal thesis is affected, since, like Russell, it  contrasts names with non-rigid descriptions. In Contemporary Perspectives in the  Philosophy of Language, Kripke addresses the relation of rigid definite  descriptions to Donnellan\u2019s referential descriptions, and discusses the relation of  these to the notion of scope.  \u2022 For the rest of Kripke\u2019s Preface, see the Appendix.        Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  2. LECTURE I    2.1 Introduction    \u2022 The lectures are informal and were delivered without notes. They have only been  patched up in a very minor way and preserve their character as delivered.  \u2022 The connection between naming and necessity will be developed during the  course of the lectures.   \u2022 Contemporary analytic philosophy uses tools involving reference and necessity, so  the discussion has far-reaching consequences, for instance in the mind-body  problem or the so-called identity thesis. This form of materialism involves  intricate questions of what is necessary or contingent in property identities and  such-like. Kripke will discuss these issues, together with concepts of substance  and natural kinds, later in the lectures.  \u2022 Kripke will introduce a different approach to the issues \u2013 though Albritton had  raised the question of natural kinds by asking whether we could discover whether  lemons are not fruits. Also, with Geach on the essentiality of origins. His views  may strike some at first sight as obviously wrong. Kripke\u2019s favourite example is  of the contemporary philosophical claim that there are contingently empty  predicates (ie. those with null extensions), and Kripke doesn\u2019t dispute this.  However, the standard example is of unicorns \u2013 which we\u2019ve discovered don\u2019t  exist, but which might have and in certain circumstances would have. Kripke  thinks this is false, because we can\u2019t say under what circumstance there would  have been unicorns. Even if archaeologists were to discover remains satisfying the  characteristics of mythological unicorns, these would not demonstrably be  remains of unicorns. Kripke has defended this view elsewhere and just mentions it  here as an example of his surprising opinions.    2.2 Naming    \u2022 Kripke now turns to his first topic, naming. By a name, Kripke means a proper  name but not a definite description (\u201cthe x such that \u03d5x\u201d). He refers to names and  definite descriptions collectively as designators.   \u2022 Donnellan has pointed out that someone may mistakenly use a definite description  to refer to someone who\u2019s not the proper referent of the description. The example  given is \u201cthe man over there drinking champagne\u201d, when \u201cthe man over there\u201d is,  in fact, drinking water. Even if there\u2019s someone else in the room that does have a  glass of champagne, the speaker intended to (and in some sense did) refer to the  man with water in his glass. Kripke, however, uses the term referent of the  description to mean the object uniquely satisfying the conditions of the  description.   \u2022 Mistakes also arise in the use of names \u2013 eg. if two people mistake the identity of  a third person. If one asks \u201cwhat is Jones doing\u201d and the other says \u201craking the  leaves\u201d, then, if the distant leaf-raker is, in fact, Smith, they are both in some  sense referring to Smith even though they both use \u201cJones\u201d as the name of Jones.  Kripke uses the \u201creferent\u201d of a name to mean the thing named by the name, ie., in  this case, Jones rather than Smith. The schema is \u201cthe referent of \u2018X\u2019 is X\u201d, where  \u2018X\u2019 is replaceable by any name or description6.    Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  \u2022 Kripke thinks that Donnellan\u2019s examples are not relevant to semantics or truthconditions, but may be to speech acts. In Kripke\u2019s sense, the referent of a name or  description is the semantic referent \u2013 the thing named or uniquely satisfying the  description. Names are not ambiguous, nor are modifications required to Russell\u2019s  theory of descriptions. Speakers may refer to things other than the semantic  referent if they have appropriate false beliefs.     2.3 Mill    \u2022 Mill wrote in A System of Logic that names have denotation but not connotation.  Mill\u2019s example is of Dartmouth: even if the course of the river Dart were to  change, we could still with propriety call Dartmouth \u201cDartmouth\u201d, despite it no  longer being at the mouth of the Dart. \u201cDartmouth\u201d does connote to some people,  but in some way it doesn\u2019t have a \u201csense\u201d. It\u2019s not part of the meaning of the name  \u201cDartmouth\u201d that Dartmouth lies at the mouth of the Dart: denying this does not  lead to a contradiction.   \u2022 The expression \u201cthe x such that \u03d5x\u201d isn\u2019t always a definite description in English.  Witness \u201cThe Holy Roman Empire\u201d or \u201cThe United Nations\u201d, which are none of  holy, Roman, empire or united, and so should be regarded as names. Kripke isn\u2019t  concerned by doubtful cases, such as \u201cGod\u201d \u2013 is this a name or a description?    2.4 Frege & Russell    \u2022 Both Frege and Russell thought that Mill was profoundly wrong, and gave the  alternative account that names are simply abbreviated or disguised definite  descriptions. Frege\u2019s view was that such a description gives the sense of the name.   \u2022 Kripke points out that this is a simplification of Russell\u2019s view because Russell  doesn\u2019t think that most standard names are names at all, because they do  abbreviate descriptions and have sense \u2013 something that names-proper don\u2019t. The  only names for Russell are demonstratives used of objects with which the reader is  acquainted. So, Russell does think names as normally understood (eg. \u201cWalter  Scott\u201d) have sense in that we should be able to give a definite description such  that the object of the description is defined as the referent of the name. In On  Denoting, Russell appears to hold that the notion of \u201csense\u201d is illusory since he  eliminates descriptions from his primitive notions7. So, Kripke differs from  Russell in two respects (1) in using the term \u201cnames\u201d in the normal sense, rather  than Russell\u2019s \u201clogically proper names\u201d and (2) in regarding descriptions and their  abbreviations as having sense.     2.5 Arguments against Mill    \u2022 Kripke thinks the arguments in favour of Frege and Russell, and against Mill, are  powerful, though he is suspicious because names don\u2019t seem to be disguised  descriptions. He gives examples of the arguments against Mill:  1. The basic problem with Mill\u2019s view is how we determine the referent of a name as  used by a given speaker. If \u201cx\u201d is just short for \u201cthe x such that uniquely \u03d5x\u201d, then  the unique \u03d5x is the referent of \u201cx\u201d (Kripke uses the example of \u201cJoe Doakes\u201d and  \u201cthe man who corrupted Hadleyburg\u201d). If there\u2019s no such descriptive content to   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  the name, how do people use names to refer to things at all? In some situations we  can point ostensively, as for Russell\u2019s doctrine of acquaintance that the so-called  genuine or proper names satisfied. But, what do we do about \u201cWalter Scott\u201d, to  whom we can\u2019t point? Our reference to Walter Scott as the unique referent of the  name seems to be determined by our knowledge of him. Frege and Russell seem  to give the natural account of how reference is determined.   2. Another motivator is the \u201cHesperus\u201d / \u201cPhosphorus\u201d problem, where we discover  that two names have the same referent and express this fact by an identity  statement. In saying \u201cHesperus is Phosphorus\u201d (and is Venus), we\u2019re not saying  that an object is self-identical but that the thing we saw in the evening is the same  as the thing we saw in the morning. Analysis in terms of descriptions gives the  real meaning of the identity statement.   3. Finally, we can ask questions of existence. In asking whether Aristotle existed, we  want to know whether anything answers to the properties normally associated  with the name. Kripke doesn\u2019t think we mean whether the thing (man) existed,  because once we\u2019ve got the thing we know it existed.   \u2022 While Kripke can\u2019t quite see his way through all these questions, he\u2019s certain that  Russell and Frege are wrong.     2.6 Quine    \u2022 Kripke mentions Quine\u2019s proposal for a reform of the language, such that in a  \u201ccanonical notation\u201d a name such as \u201cSocrates\u201d should be replaced by a  description \u201cthe Socratizer\u201d, \u201cSocratizes\u201d being an invented predicate, and the  description eliminated by Russell\u2019s method8. As this is not a substantive theory of  reference for names, it is not addressed by Kripke. However, he notes that Quine  would agree that similar problems to (1) \u2013 (3) above occur: namely, how is the  extension of \u201cSocratizes\u201d determined.     2.7 Cluster Concept    \u2022 While many have abandoned the letter of Frege and Russell\u2019s theory, they\u2019ve  retained the spirit in the form of a \u201ccluster concept\u201d. Kripke quotes Frege\u2019s  recognition of a problem where opinions on the sense of proper names can  diverge. For instance, someone who accepts the sense of \u201cAristotle\u201d as \u201cthe  Stagirite teacher of Alexander\u201d will interpret the meaning of \u201cAristotle was born  in Stagira\u201d differently from someone who simply accepts the sense of \u201cAristotle\u201d  as \u201cPlato\u2019s disciple and the teacher of Alexander\u201d. There is thus a looseness in the  language, with different people giving different senses to names. Even a single  person may consider that any particular fact he knows about the person named is  contingent. It\u2019s not part of the meaning of \u201cAristotle\u201d (part of the sense of the  name \u201cAristotle\u201d) that he taught Alexander, for this fact is something that could be  found to be false.   \u2022 The most common way out is to suggest that we usually associate a family of  descriptions with a proper name, as Wittgenstein suggests in Philosophical  Socratizers are ugly\u201d. Does this relate to Mark Underwood\u2019s insistence that \u201cThe present King of  France is bald\u201d equates to \u201cone and only one person currently kings France, and whoever currently  kings France is bald\u201d.    Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  Investigations, \u00a779, where he asks how much of what the Bible attributes to  Moses must be proved false before my equation of \u201cMoses\u201d with \u201cthe man who  did what the Bible relates of Moses, or as any rate, a good deal of it\u201d is proved  false. Kripke states that the locus classicus of this view, rather more plausible as  an analysis of ordinary language than Frege and Russell\u2019s, is Searle\u2019s article  Proper Names. The referent of a name is seen not to be determined by a single  description but by a cluster or family. Whatever in some sense satisfies enough or  most of the family is the referent of the name. Kripke will return later to this view,  which appears to retain the virtues, while escaping the defects, of the FregeRussell theory. There are, however, two ways in which the cluster concept (or  even the single description theory) can be viewed.  (1) The cluster or single description gives the meaning of the name: ie., when  someone says \u201cWalter Scott\u201d he means \u201cthe man such that such and such and  such and such\u201d (*).   (2) Alternatively, while the description doesn\u2019t give the meaning of the name, and  there is no synonymy involved, it determines its reference. If, on examining  the account of the descriptions, we find them more appropriate to Salvador  Dali, then for this person, \u201cWalter Scott\u201d refers to Salvador Dali rather than  Walter Scott.   \u2022 Kripke thinks that some of those (eg. Paul Ziff) who deny even more strongly than  he does that names have meaning still use this picture of how the referent of a  name gets determined. Ziff claims that the names of things with which we are  acquainted are assigned differently (by baptism or ostentation) to those of  historical figures (by clusters of descriptions). For Ziff, proper names ordinarily  are neither words of the language nor have any meaning at all.    2.8 Reference or Meaning?    \u2022 Kripke thinks that some of the attractiveness of the Frege-Russell theory is lost if  it\u2019s used as a theory of reference rather than as a theory of meaning, as some of  the solutions to the problems will evaporate if the description doesn\u2019t give the  meaning of the name. Eg. For \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d to mean \u201cno man did such  and such\u201d we need to take the theory in question as a theory of meaning of the  name \u201cMoses\u201d, not just as a theory of its reference. Kripke isn\u2019t fully clear about  this, and maybe all that\u2019s immediately clear now is that if \u201cMoses\u201d means \u201cthe  man who did such and such\u201d, then denying Moses\u2019 existence denies the existence  of the man who did such and such, ie. denies that anyone did such and such. On  the other hand, if \u201cMoses\u201d is not synonymous with any description, statements  involving the name cannot be analysed by replacing the name by a description.  This is so even if the reference is in some sense determined by a description and  statements involving the name may be materially equivalent to those involving the  description. Hence, we have to abandon the above analysis of singular existence  statements (*), and also of identity statements, unless we can establish the  procedure independently of the general theory of the meaning of names. Kripke,  however, thinks it false that \u201cMoses exists\u201d means anything like \u201c(*) exists\u201d, so  we won\u2019t pursue this further. Kripke has an interesting footnote to the effect that  determinists who claim that if Moses hadn\u2019t existed someone else would have  arisen to achieve what he did cannot be refuted by a correct philosophical  understanding of the meaning of \u201cMoses existed\u201d.      Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  2.9 Five Distinctions    \u2022 Kripke turns to a batch of terms \u2013 analytic, a priori, necessary, certain \u2013 that are  taken to mean the same thing. Kant distinguished between a priori and analytic,  so maybe people still do, but virtually no one distinguishes between a priori and  necessary  though, Kripke will.     2.9.1 Distinction 1 : \u201cA Priori\u201d versus \u201cA Posteriori\u201d    \u2022 Firstly, the a priori : A prioricity is an epistemological concept, a priori truths  being, according to Kant, those that can be known independently of any  experience. This implies it\u2019s possible for such things to be known independently  of experience \u2013 but by whom  God, Martians or people with minds like ours?  Clarifying the question might raise all sorts of questions about the modality  involved, so better to side-step the issue and avoid reference to \u201ca priori truths\u201d  and simply ask whether a particular person knows or believes something true on  the basis of a priori evidence.   \u2022 Some philosophers erroneously change the modality from \u201ccan be known\u201d to  \u201cmust be known (independently of experience)\u201d, mistakenly thinking that  anything belonging to the realm of the a priori couldn\u2019t possibly be known  empirically. An example is believing a computer when it tells us a number is  prime \u2013 we believe it on the basis of our knowledge of the laws of physics and the  construction of the machine, ie., on the basis of a posteriori evidence, despite the  fact that this could be know a priori by someone performing the necessary  calculations themselves.     2.9.2 Distinction 2 \u2013 \u201cNecessary\u201d versus \u201cSufficient\u201d    \u2022 Secondly, necessity. This is a metaphysical rather than epistemological notion.  Something false is obviously not necessarily true, but might something true have  been false and the world be different than it is? If the answer is \u201cno\u201d, then the fact  about the world is necessary, else it\u2019s contingent. This is independent of  knowledge, and the equation of the a priori with the necessary is a philosophical  thesis rather than a definitional relation. Both concepts may be vague, but we are  dealing with two different domains, the epistemological and the metaphysical.  Kripke turns to the example of Goldbach\u2019s conjecture which, whether it is true or  false, is presumably necessarily so (taking the classical view that mathematics is  either true or false).   \u2022 If the Goldbach conjecture is false, then \u2203 an even n > 2 such that for no two  primes p1 and p2, n = p1 + p2. If this fact about n is true, it is verifiable by direct  computation and so is necessary if arithmetical calculations are necessary. If the  conjecture is true, then every even n > 2 is the sum of two primes. If this is the  case, could it have been false? For it to be false, there would have to be a counterexample as in the case where the Goldbach conjecture is false. But, whichever  value of n this should turn out to be, because we\u2019ve supposed the Goldbach  conjecture to be true, there must be two primes p1 and p2, such that n = p1 + p2.  This also can be determined by direct computation. So, whatever truth value  belongs to Goldbach\u2019s conjecture belongs to it necessarily.   \u2022 However, in the absence of a decisive mathematical proof deciding the question,  none of us knows whether Goldbach\u2019s conjecture is true or false, so we certainly   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  don\u2019t have a priori knowledge of its truth or falsity. It will be alleged that we can  know this in principle \u2013 but, can a finite mind search all the numbers, and how do  we know there\u2019s a decisive mathematical proof? Hilbert thought that there\u2019s an  intuitive proof or disproof deciding any mathematical question, but others have  denied this, and yet others have thought the question unintelligible unless we  replace the notion of an intuitive proof by a formal proof in a single system, which  is impossible as G\u00f6del showed.  The question is non-trivial and even if the  conjecture is necessary if true, it doesn\u2019t follow that anyone knows anything a  priori about it or even whether they could know anything a priori about it. The  assertion that, even if no-one ever will know a priori whether Goldbach\u2019s  conjecture is right, yet there is a way which could have been used to settle the  question a priori, is non-trivial.   \u2022 Hence, the terms \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201ca priori\u201d are not obviously synonymous when  applied to statements, and an argument is required to connect them. Kripke will  argue that they are not co-extensive: that both necessary a posteriori truths and  probably contingent a priori truths exist. Kripke thinks people have thought the  terms meant the same for the following reasons:  (1) If something is true in all possible worlds, we ought to be able to run through  these worlds in our heads and see its necessity a priori. But, this procedure is  not at all obviously feasible.  (2) Conversely, if something is known a prior, it\u2019s known without looking at the  world, so must be necessary  for if it depended on some feature of the actual  world, how could you know without looking? Couldn\u2019t the actual world be  one of the possible worlds in which it would have been false. Kripke says that  this thought depends on the thesis that there can\u2019t be a way of knowing about  the actual world without looking that wouldn\u2019t be a way of knowing the same  thing about every possible world. This is vague as stated, involves problems of  the nature of knowledge and, in any case, is non-trivial.   \u2022 Whether or not there are counter-examples, the important thing is to see that the  notions of necessity and a prioricity are different and that it\u2019s non-trivial to argue  that something that can only be known a posteriori isn\u2019t necessary or that  something known a priori is a necessary truth.     2.9.3 Distinction 3 \u2013 \u201cAnalytic\u201d versus \u201cSynthetic\u201d    \u2022 Thirdly, analytic. Kripke stipulates that an analytic statement is in some sense true  in all possible worlds by virtue of its meaning. Then, it\u2019s also stipulative that an  analytic statement is both a priori and necessary.     2.9.4 Distinction 4 \u2013 \u201cCertainty\u201d    \u2022 Fourthly, certainty. This is another epistemological notion, and it\u2019s not obvious  that everything that\u2019s necessary is certain. Something can at least be rationally  believed a priori without being quite certain. Kripke\u2019s examples are proofs read in  maths books, or calculations that may contain mistakes.     2.9.5 Distinction 5 \u2013 Modality \u201cde re\u201d and \u201cde dicto\u201d    \u2022 Finally, Kripke wants to address one more preliminary question, the distinction  between belief in modality de re and de dicto (ie. between essentialism and a mere   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  advocacy of necessity). It is alleged that it\u2019s only a statement or state of affairs  that is necessary or contingent  whether a particular necessarily or contingently  has a certain property depends on the way it\u2019s described \u2013 whether an object has  the same properties in all possible worlds depends not just on the object, but how  it\u2019s described. Kripke gives two examples:   (1) Quine\u2019s \u2013 is the number 9 necessarily odd, odd in all possible worlds? Nine is  necessarily odd, but we can also pick out 9 as \u201cthe number of the planets\u201d,  which is not necessarily 9 (there might have been 8) and so is not necessarily  odd.   (2) Was it necessary or contingent that Nixon won the 1968 US election? If we  designate Nixon as \u201cthe man who won the 1968 election\u201d, then it\u2019s necessary  that he won it.   \u2022 It\u2019s suggested in the literature that, while we have some intuitive notion of  necessity and contingency, it\u2019s just a notion invented by a bad philosopher who  didn\u2019t realise that there are several ways of referring to the same thing. Kripke  thinks it is intuitive that a property can meaningfully be held to be essential or  accidental to an object independently of its description. Kripke returns to the case  of Nixon. The intuitive man, rather than the philosopher with a theory, on pointing  to Nixon would say with conviction that he might have lost the election, that the  winner might have been someone else. \u201cThe winner\u201d and \u201cthe loser\u201d don\u2019t  designate the same objects in all possible worlds. \u201cNixon\u201d is just the name of this  man. The question whether it is necessary or contingent that Nixon won the  election is the intuitive one whether in some counterfactual situation, this man  would have lost. Someone thinking that the notion of a necessary or contingent  property is just a philosopher\u2019s notion devoid of intuitive content is wrong.   \u2022 Kripke points out in a footnote the distinction between the meaningfulness of the  distinction between essential and accidental properties, that is, whether it just  depends on how things are described, and whether there are any essential  properties. Kripke thinks there are, while some idealists think that all properties  are essential. Kripke differs from many philosophers in deeming intuitive content  very heavy evidence \u2013 maybe the most conclusive \u2013 in favour of something.  People who think the notion of accidental properties unintuitive have their  intuitions round the wrong way.     2.10 Identity Across Possible Worlds    \u2022 A motivator for this \u201cphilosopher\u2019s\u201d perspective is the problem of \u201cidentity across  possible worlds\u201d9. Imagine another possible world where no-one has all the  properties of Nixon \u2013 which, if any, of the people in it is Nixon? We would seem  to need a criterion of identity, which we can then use to tell whether Nixon in this  possible world has certain properties and also whether in some possible world  Nixon lost the election. However, criteria for identity are very difficult. Even in  the most promising case \u2013 that of numbers \u2013 there are problems. Taking the  number 9 to be what it is based on its position in the sequence of natural numbers,  then if, in another possible world, the number of planets had been 8, we wouldn\u2019t  in that world use the number 9 to identify their number. In the case of material  how Leibniz\u2019s Law fits in, given that the whole point of possible worlds is to have different  properties. Is this the motivation for Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory?    Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  objects and people, has anyone given necessary and sufficient conditions for  identity across possible worlds?  \u2022 Kripke agrees that necessary and sufficient conditions for identity are very rare.  Mathematics is the only case where they are given within a possible world, and  Kripke knows of no criteria for the identity over time of material things or people.  However, Kripke thinks this approach misses the point of what a possible world  is. Kripke thinks people imagine possible worlds as like another country to which  Nixon may or may not have gone, and where we observe people\u2019s qualities but  not whether or not they are Nixon.    \u2022 Kripke himself may be a prominent example of a logician whose formal treatment  of modal logic may encourage this picture. Nevertheless, intuitively speaking, it  doesn\u2019t seem to Kripke to be the right way of thinking about possible worlds,  which are too far away to be seen through a telescope. Instead, a possible world is  given by the descriptive conditions we associate with it. Kripke imagines the  possible world in which he didn\u2019t give today\u2019s lecture. Not everything is  imagined, only those relevant to his giving the lecture, though, theoretically  everything needs to be decided to give a possible world. Kripke first asks and then  states that possible worlds are stipulated, not discovered. It\u2019s part of the  description of a possible world that it contains Nixon and that he didn\u2019t win the  election. Some stipulations may not be possible, but this one seems to be OK. In  this possible world, the person who lost the election is Nixon, because that\u2019s part  of the description of the world. We stipulate that, in talking about what would  have happened to Nixon in some counterfactual situation, we are talking about  him.   \u2022 We can\u2019t do this if we insist that every possible world has to be described in a  purely qualitatively way \u2013 so that we can\u2019t say \u201csuppose Nixon \u2026\u201d, but have to  say \u201csuppose somebody (\u2026 description \u2026.) \u2026\u201d. We then have to ask whether  such a person resembles Nixon sufficiently to be identified with him. David  Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory is a blatant example of this way of thinking. This isn\u2019t  the way we normally think of counterfactual situations. We just say \u201csuppose this  man had lost\u201d, and it is given that the possible world contains this man. Even  though there may be problems about what intuitions about possibility come to,  they are about this man, and need not be identified with the electoral loss of some  man qualitatively described as looking like this and having certain political views.  We just point to the man, and ask what might have happened to him had events  been different.     2.11 Counterpart Theory    \u2022 Kripke has a longish footnote on Lewis\u2019s paper \u201cCounterpart Theory and  Quantified Modal Logic\u201d10, which is said to contain a formal difficulty (which  Kripke describes, but which I won\u2019t go into \u2013 see. P. 45) that, along with other  reasons not elaborated, leads Kripke to conclude that Lewis\u2019s philosophical views  on counterparts are wrong. Lewis\u2019s view is not one of transworld identification  because Lewis thinks that similarities across possible worlds determine a  counterpart relation that is neither symmetric nor transitive. The counterpart is  never identical with the thing itself, so counterfactuals don\u2019t happen to the person  himself but to some counterpart. Kripke thinks that Humphrey couldn\u2019t have cared   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  less should someone else, however closely resembling him, have won the election   and hence, that Lewis\u2019s views are even more bizarre than those they replace11.  However, what\u2019s common to both sets of views is that other possible worlds are  like other dimensions of a more inclusive universe which can only be given by  purely qualitative descriptions, and that the identity or counterpart relation has to  be established in terms of qualitative resemblance.      2.12 Necessary & Sufficient Conditions for being a Particular Sortal    \u2022 Someone might allege that the question whether Nixon could have had certain  properties other than those he actually had is equivalent to the question whether  the criteria of identity across possible worlds include that Nixon does not have  these properties. Kripke thinks this is wrong and that there are two things going  on, for the reason that the usual condition for transworld identity demands that we  have purely qualitative necessary and sufficient conditions for someone being  Nixon. If we can\u2019t imagine a possible world in which Nixon does not have a  certain property, it\u2019s necessary that he has it or, equivalently, it is a necessary  condition of someone being Nixon. Such a property might be Nixon being a  human being, in any world in which Nixon exists he is a human being, or at least  not an inanimate object. This is independent of any purely qualitative sufficient  conditions for Nixonhood. There may be arguments in favour of sufficient  conditions, but they are not relevant to our concern for necessary conditions. Even  if there were a set of purely qualitative necessary and sufficient conditions for  being Nixon, the approach Kripke advocates neither requires that we know them  before we can ask whether Nixon might not have won the election, nor do we  need to restate the question in their terms. We simply consider Nixon and ask what  might have happened to him. Consequently, the two approaches are quite  different.   \u2022 Consideration of the case whether Nixon might not have been an automaton is not  an epistemological matter. While we might need evidence whether Nixon was a  human being or an automaton, questions about whether he might have been an  automaton given that he was a human being are not questions of knowledge, but  questions whether things might have been otherwise.   \u2022 Consider this table. It is one question whether it is made of molecules, and how  we know this \u2013 it was a momentous scientific discovery that things are made of  molecules or atoms. It is an entirely different question whether it might not have  been made of molecules12 and yet remained the same object (and, intuitively, the  answer to this question is \u201cno\u201d).     2.13 Rigid Designators    \u2022 Kripke now introduces some essential terminology for his theory of names. We  need the notion of \u201cidentity across possible worlds\u201d. He thinks this expression  misleading because it implies (1) that the \u201cidentification\u201d problem cannot be  trivially solved by stipulation and (2) because \u201cpossible worlds\u201d, while useful in  the set-theoretic model-theory of modal logic, suggests the \u201cforeign country\u201d  picture and invites pseudo-problems  Kripke sometimes prefers \u201ccounterfactual   Saul Kripke \u2013 Naming and Necessity  Notes  situation\u201d. In any case, we want to know why it\u2019s necessary that 9 is greater than  7, but not necessary that the number of planets is greater than 7 \u2013 why the one  shows more about essence than the other.   \u2022 So, Kripke defines a rigid designator as something that designates the  same object in every possible world  non-rigid or accidental designators13 don\u2019t  do this. We don\u2019t require a rigidly designated object to exist in every possible  world (as in that in which Nixon\u2019s parents had never met), though a rigid  designator of a necessary existent14 is called strongly rigid.     2.14 Names as Rigid Designators    \u2022 Kripke maintains the intuitive thesis that names are rigid designators. While  someone other than Nixon might have been US President in 1970, so \u201cthe USP in  1970\u201d is a non-rigid designator, but no-one other than Nixon could have been  Nixon (even though in some possible worlds he might not have been called  Nixon15). So, \u201cNixon\u201d is a rigid, but not strongly rigid16, designator.     2.15 Trans-world Identificat", "filename": "Somebpdy analyses Kripke - Naming and Necessity.pdf", "meta": {"bla": "huahaua"}}
