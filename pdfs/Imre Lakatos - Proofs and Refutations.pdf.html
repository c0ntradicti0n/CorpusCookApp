   preface   to   this   edition   Editors   ’   preface   Our   great   friend   and   teacher   Imre   Lakatos   died   unexpectedly   on   2   February   1974   .   At   the   time   he   was   (   as   usual   )   <br> </br>
   engaged   on   many   intellectual   projects   .   One   of   the   most   important   of   these   was   the   publication   of   a   modified   and   extended   version   of   his   brilliant   essay   ‘   <br> </br>
   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   ,   which   appeared   in   four   parts   in   The   British   Journal   for   the   Philosophy   of   Science   ,   14   ,   19634   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Lakatos </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> had   long   had   a   contract   for   this   book   ,   but   had   held   back   publication   in   the   hope   of   amending   and   further   improving   the   essay   ,   and   of   adding   to   it </span>  <br> </br>

During   that   summer   we   each   discussed   plans   for   the   book   with   him   ,   and   we   have   <br> </br>
   tried   to   produce   a   book   which   ,   in   the   sadly   changed   circumstances   ,   is   as   similar   as   possible   to   the   one   then   projected   by   Lakatos   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   have   thus   included   three   new   items   in   addition   to   the   original   ‘   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   essay   (   which   appears   here   as   Chapter   1   )   .   First   we   have   added   a   <br> </br>
   second   part   to   the   main   text   .   This   concerns   Poincar   ’s   vector-algebraic   proof   of   the   DescartesEuler   conjecture   .   It   is   based   on   chapter   2   of   Lakatos   ’s   1961   <br> </br>
   Cambridge   Ph.D.   thesis   .   (   The   original   ‘   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   essay   was   a   much   amended   and   improved   version   of   chapter   1   of   that   thesis   .   )   A   part   of   <br> </br>
   chapter   3   of   this   thesis   becomes   here   appendix   1   ,   which   contains   a   further   case-study   in   the   method   of   proofs   and   refutations   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   concerned   with   Cauchy   ’s   proof   of   the   theorem   that   the   limit   of   any   convergent   series   of   continuous   functions   is   itself   continuous   .   <br> </br>

   elie   zahar   editors   ’   preface   xi   I   shall   refer   to   the   school   of   mathematical   philosophy   which   tends   to   identify   mathematics   with   its   formal   axiomatic   <br> </br>
   abstraction   (   and   the   philosophy   of   mathematics   with   metamathematics   )   as   the   ‘   formalist   ’   school   .   One   of   the   clearest   statements   of   the   formalist   <br> </br>
   position   is   to   be   found   in   Carnap   [   1937   ]   .   Carnap   demands   that   (   a   )   ‘   philosophy   is   to   be   replaced   by   the   logic   of   science   .   .   .   ’   ,   (   b   )   ‘   the   logic   of   science   is   <br> </br>

   peculiar   status   of   Gdelian   sentences   from   this   point   of   view   is   that   these   theorems   are   theorems   of   informal   mathematics   ,   and   that   in   fact   they   are   <br> </br>

   place   in   an   imaginary   classroom   .   The   class   gets   interested   in   a   PROBLEM   :   is   there   a   relation   between   the   number   of   vertices   V   ,   the   number   of   edges   E   and   the   <br> </br>
   number   of   faces   F   of   polyhedra   particularly   of   regular   polyhedra   analogous   to   the   trivial   relation   between   the   number   of   vertices   and   edges   of   polygons   ,   <br> </br>
   namely   ,   that   there   are   as   many   edges   as   vertices   :   V   E   ?   <br> </br>

   that   besides   the   number   of   faces   the   number   of   points   and   lines   on   the   surface   of   the   polyhedron   determines   its   (   topological   )   character   .   It   is   interesting   <br> </br>
   that   on   the   one   hand   he   was   eager   to   stress   the   novelty   of   his   conceptual   framework   ,   and   that   he   had   to   invent   the   term   ‘   acies   ’   (   edge   )   instead   of   the   old   ‘   latus   <br> </br>
   ’   (   side   )   ,   since   latus   was   a   polygonal   concept   while   he   wanted   a   polyhedral   one   ,   on   the   other   hand   he   still   retained   the   term   ‘   angulus   solidus   ’   (   solid   angle   )   <br> </br>

   It   has   been   recently   generally   accepted   that   the   priority   of   the   result   goes   to   Descartes   .   The   ground   for   this   claim   is   a   manuscript   of   Descartes   [   c.   1639   ]   <br> </br>
   copied   by   Leibniz   in   Paris   from   the   original   in   16756   ,   and   rediscovered   and   published   by   Foucher   de   Careil   in   1860   .   The   priority   should   not   be   granted   to   <br> </br>
   Descartes   without   a   minor   qualification   .   It   is   true   that   Descartes   states   that   the   number   of   plane   angles   equals   2   +   2   -   4   where   by   hemeans   the   number   of   faces   <br> </br>
   and   by   the   number   of   solid   angles   .   It   is   also   true   that   he   states   that   there   are   twice   as   many   plane   angles   as   edges   (   latera   )   .   <br> </br>
