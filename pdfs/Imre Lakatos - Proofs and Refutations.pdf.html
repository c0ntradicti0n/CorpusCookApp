   www.cambridge.orgcore   Preface   to   this   edition   paolo   mancosu   B   Proofs   and   Refutations   is   one   of   the   undeniable   classics   of   the   philosophy   of   mathematics   <br> </br>
   .   Fifty   years   have   passed   since   the   publication   of   the   articles   that   make   up   its   central   core   ,   but   the   book   has   lost   neither   its   freshness   nor   its   <br> </br>
   provocative   vitality   .   It   takes   the   form   of   a   classroom   dialogue   in   which   a   group   of   students   and   their   teacher   investigate   the   problem   of   whether   there   is   a   <br> </br>
   relation   that   holds   between   the   number   of   vertices   V   ,   the   number   of   edges   E   ,   and   the   number   of   faces   F   of  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> regular </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> polyhedra </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   e.g.   the   five   Platonic   solids   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   At   the   outset   of   the   dialogues   they   have   arrived   at   the   formula   V   E   +   F   2   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   conjecture   that   the   result   might   extend   to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> any </span></span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> polyhedron </span></span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Euler </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ’s </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> conjecture </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span></span>  ,   and   this   is   the   starting   point   of   a   riveting   development   that   <br> </br>
   carries   the   reader   through   the   rational   reconstruction   ,   as   embodied   in   the   class   dialogue   ,   of   the   history   of   Euler   ’s   conjecture   ,   culminating   in   Poincar   <br> </br>
   ’s   proof   .   The   reconstruction   ,   in   strong   contrast   to   a   piece   of   axiomatic   mathematics   ,   features   contradictions   ,   monsters   ,   counterexamples   ,   <br> </br>
   conjectures   ,   concept-stretchings   ,   hidden   lemmas   ,   proofs   ,   and   a   wide   range   of   informal   moves   meant   to   account   for   the   rationality   of   the   process   leading   <br> </br>
   to   concept-formation   and   conjecturesproofs   in   mathematical   practice   .   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   A   starker   contrast   with   the   formalist   foundational   approach   dominant   up   to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> 1960s </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   and   embodied   in   philosophies   of   mathematics   of   neo-positivist </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> inspiration   ) </span>  can   scarcely   be   imagined   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Whereas   the   latter   ,   inspired   by   Euclid   ’s   infallibilist   dogmatic   style   ,   thought   of   mathematical   theories   statically   as   axiomatic   systems   ,   Lakatos   was   <br> </br>
   after   an   account   of   informal   mathematics   as   a   fallible   dynamic   body   of   knowledge   .   Rejecting   the   positivist   distinction   between   context   of   discovery   and   <br> </br>
   context   of   justification   ,   he   claimed   that   mathematical   practice   and   its   history   are   not   the   domain   of   the   irrational   but   rather   display   an   objectivity   <br> </br>
   and   rationality   that   any   philosophy   of   mathematics   worth   its   name   should   account   for   .   The   tools   for   addressing   the   rationality   of   mathematical   growth   <br> </br>
   could   not   ,   however   ,   be   those   of   formal   logic   ,   whose   ‘   deductivist   style   ’   could   only   address   issues   of   the   static   variety   and   was   thus   unable   to   account   for   <br> </br>
   concept-formation   and   vii   the   rational   dynamics   driving   the   development   of   informal   mathematics   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Rather   ,   Lakatos   found   inspiration   in   Polya   ’s   work   on   mathematical   heuristics   ,   Hegel   ’s   dialectic   ,   and   Popperian   conjecture   and   refutation   .   This   led   to   <br> </br>
   Lakatos   ’s   dialectical   methodology   ,   a   ‘   heuristic   style   ’   that   reveals   the   struggle   and   the   adventure   of   mathematical   creation   .   There   will   always   be   <br> </br>
   disagreements   as   to   whether   or   to   what   extent   Lakatos   ’s   case   studies   are   paradigmatic   and   can   be   extended   to   mathematics   as   a   whole   .   Scholars   will   also   <br> </br>
   continue   to   disagree   about   the   suitability   of   the   dialectical   framework   for   accounting   for   mathematical   growth   and   the   role   of   mathematical   logic   in   the   <br> </br>
   history   and   philosophy   of   mathematics   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   characteristic   trait   of   a   classic   is   its   rich   and   varied   legacy   .   Proofs   and   Refutations   stands   up   to   this   test   ,   for   it   continues   to   be   a   source   of   <br> </br>
   inspiration   to   many   historians   ,   mathematicians   ,   and   philosophers   who   aspire   to   develop   a   philosophy   of   mathematics   that   does   justice   to   the   static   and   <br> </br>
   dynamic   complexity   of   mathematical   practice   .   viii   preface   to   this   edition   Editors   ’   preface   B   Our   great   friend   and   teacher   Imre   Lakatos   died   <br> </br>
   unexpectedly   on   2   February   1974   .   At   the   time   he   was   (   as   usual   )   engaged   on   many   intellectual   projects   .   One   of   the   most   important   of   these   was   the   publication   <br> </br>
   of   a   modified   and   extended   version   of   his   brilliant   essay   ‘   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   ,   which   appeared   in   four   parts   in   The   British   Journal   for   the   Philosophy   <br> </br>
   of   Science   ,   14   ,   19634   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Lakatos   had   long   had   a   contract   for   this   book   ,   but   had   held   back   publication   in   the   hope   of   amending   and   further   improving   the   essay   ,   and   of   adding   to   it   <br> </br>
   substantial   extra   material   .   This   work   was   considerably   delayed   by   the   diversion   of   his   interests   to   the   philosophy   of   physical   science   ,   but   in   the   summer   <br> </br>
   of   1973   he   finally   decided   to   go   ahead   with   the   publication   .   During   that   summer   we   each   discussed   plans   for   the   book   with   him   ,   and   we   have   tried   to   produce   a   <br> </br>
   book   which   ,   in   the   sadly   changed   circumstances   ,   is   as   similar   as   possible   to   the   one   then   projected   by   Lakatos   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   have   thus   included   three   new   items   in   addition   to  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> original </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ‘   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   essay   (   which   appears   here   as   Chapter   1   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   First   we   have   added   a   second   part   to   the   main   text   .   This   concerns   Poincar   ’s   vector-algebraic   proof   of   the   DescartesEuler   conjecture   .   It   is   based   on   <br> </br>
   chapter   2   of   Lakatos   ’s   1961   Cambridge   Ph.D.   thesis   .   (   The   original   ‘   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   essay   was   a   much   amended   and   improved   version   of   chapter   1   of   <br> </br>
   that   thesis   .   )   A   part   of   chapter   3   of   this   thesis   becomes   here   appendix   1   ,   which   contains   a   further   case-study   in   the   method   of   proofs   and   refutations   .   It   is   <br> </br>
   concerned   with   Cauchy   ’s   proof   of   the   theorem   that   the   limit   of   any   convergent   series   of   continuous   functions   is   itself   continuous   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Chapter   2   of   the   main   text   and   appendix   1   should   allay   the   doubt   ,   often   expressed   by   mathematicians   who   have   read   ‘   Proofs   and   Refutations   ’   ,   that   ,   while   the   <br> </br>
   method   of   proof-analysis   described   by   Lakatos   may   be   applicable   to   the   study   of   polyhedra   ,   a   subject   which   is   ‘   near   empirical   ’   and   where   the   <br> </br>
   counterexamples   are   easily   visualisable   ,   it   may   be   inapplicable   to   ‘   real   ’   mathematics   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> third   additional   item  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> appendix </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> 2 </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span>  is   also   based   on   a   part   of   chapter   3   of   Lakatos   ’s   thesis   .   It   is   about   the   consequences   of   his   position   for   the   <br> </br>
   development   ,   presentation   and   teaching   of   mathematics   .   ix   One   of   the   reasons   Lakatos   delayed   publication   was   his   recognition   that   some   of   this   extra   <br> </br>
   material   ,   whilst   containing   many   new   points   and   developments   of   his   position   ,   was   in   need   of   further   consideration   and   further   historical   research   .   <br> </br>
   This   is   particularly   true   of  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> material </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   in   appendix   1   ) </span>  on   Cauchy   and   Fourier   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   also   are   aware   of   certain   difficulties   and   ambiguities   in   this   material   and   of   omissions   from   it   .   We   felt   ,   however   ,   that   we   should   not   change   the   content   <br> </br>
   of   what   Lakatos   had   written   .   As   for   elaborating   on   ,   and   adding   to   ,   the   material   ,   neither   of   us   was   in   a   position   to   supply   the   necessary   long   and   detailed   <br> </br>
   historical   research   .   Faced   then   with   the   alternatives   of   not   publishing   the   material   at   all   ,   or   publishing   it   in   an   unfinished   state   ,   we   decided   on   the   <br> </br>
   latter   option   .   We   feel   that   there   is   much   of   interest   in   it   ,   and   hope   that   it   will   stimulate   other   scholars   to   extend   and   correct   it   if   necessary   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   general   ,   we   did   not   think   it   right   to   modify   the   content   of   Lakatos   ’s   material   ,   even   those   parts   of   it   about   which   we   were   confident   Lakatos   had   changed   <br> </br>
   his   position   .   We   have   therefore   restricted   ourselves   to   pointing   out   (   in   notes   marked   with   asterisks   )   some   of   those   things   we   should   have   tried   to   <br> </br>
   persuade   Lakatos   to   change   and   (   which   often   amounts   to   the   same   thing   )   some   of   those   points   we   believe   Lakatos   would   have   changed   in   publishing   this   <br> </br>
   material   now   .   (   His   intellectual   position   had   ,   of   course   ,   changed   considerably   during   the   thirteen   years   between   completing   the   Ph.D.   thesis   and   his   <br> </br>
   death   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   major   changes   in   his   general   philosophy   are   explained   in   his   [   1970   ]   .   We   should   mention   that   Lakatos   thought   that   his   methodology   of   scientific   <br> </br>
   research   programmes   had   important   implications   for   his   philosophy   of   mathematics   .   )   Our   approach   to   matters   of   presentation   has   been   to   leave   the   <br> </br>
   material   which   Lakatos   had   himself   published  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   i.e.   chapter   1   of   the   main   text   )   almost   entirely   unchanged   (   the   only   exceptions   are   a   few   misprints   and </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> unambiguous   minor   slips   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   have   ,   however   ,   rather   substantially   modified   the   previously   unpublished   material   though   ,   to   repeat   ,   only   in   form   and   not   in   content   .   Since   this   may   <br> </br>
   seem   a   rather   unusual   procedure   ,   perhaps   a   few   words   of   justification   are   in   order   .   Lakatos   always   took   a   great   deal   of   care   over   the   presentation   of   any   of   <br> </br>
   his   material   which   was   to   be   published   ,   and   ,   prior   to   publication   ,   he   always   had   such   material   widely   circulated   amongst   colleagues   and   friends   ,   for   <br> </br>
   criticism   and   suggested   improvements   .   We   are   sure   that   the   material   here   published   for   the   first   time   would   have   undergone   this   treatment   ,   and   that   the   <br> </br>
   changes   would   have   been   more   drastic   than   those   we   have   dared   to   introduce   .   <br> </br>

   Our   knowledge  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> through </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> personal </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> experience </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span>  of   the   pains   Lakatos   took   to   present   his   position   as   clearly   as   possible   x   editors   ’   preface   obliged   us   to   try   <br> </br>
   to   improve   the   presentation   of   this   material   as   best   we   could   .   It   is   certain   that   these   new   items   do   not   read   as   well   as   they   would   have   done   ,   had   Lakatos   <br> </br>
   himself   revised   the   material   on   which   they   are   based   ,   but   we   felt   that   we   were   close   enough   to   Lakatos   ,   and   involved   enough   in   some   of   his   previous   <br> </br>
   publications   ,   to   make   a   reasonable   attempt   at   bringing   the   material   up   to   somewhere   near   his   own   high   standards   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   are   very   pleased   to   have   had   the   opportunity   to   produce   this   edition   of   some   of   Lakatos   ’s   important   work   in   the   philosophy   of   mathematics   ,   for   it   allows   <br> </br>
   us   to   discharge   part   of   the   intellectual   and   personal   debt   we   both   owe   him   .   john   worrall   elie   zahar   editors   ’   preface   xi   Author   ’s   introduction   B   It   <br> </br>
   frequently   happens   in   the   history   of   thought   that   when   a   powerful   new   method   emerges   the   study   of   those   problems   which   can   be   dealt   with   by   the   new   method   <br> </br>
   advances   rapidly   and   attracts   the   limelight   ,   while   the   rest   tends   to   be   ignored   or   even   forgotten   ,   its   study   despised   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   situation   seems   to   have   arisen   in   our   century   in   the   Philosophy   of   Mathematics   as   a   result   of   the   dynamic   development   of   metamathematics   .   The   subject   <br> </br>
   matter   of   metamathematics   is   an   abstraction   of   mathematics   in   which   mathematical   theories   are   replaced   by   formal   systems   ,   proofs   by   certain   sequences   <br> </br>
   of   well-formed   formulae   ,   definitions   by   ‘   abbreviatory   devices   ’   which   are   ‘   theoretically   dispensable   ’   but   ‘   typographically   convenient’.1   This   <br> </br>
   abstraction   was   devised   by   Hilbert   to   provide   a   powerful   technique   for   approaching   some   of   the   problems   of   the   methodology   of   mathematics   .   At   the   same   <br> </br>
   time   there   are   problems   which   fall   outside   the   range   of   metamathematical   abstractions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Among   these   are   all   problems   relating   to   informal   <br> </br>

   Or   :   philosophy   of   mathematics   is   to   be   replaced   by   metamathematics   .   1   Formalism   disconnects   the   history   of   mathematics   from   the   philosophy   of   <br> </br>
   mathematics   ,   since   ,   according   to   the   formalist   concept   of   mathematics   ,   there   is   no   history   of   mathematics   proper   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Any   formalist   would   basically   agree   with   Russell   ’s   ‘   romantically   ’   put   but   seriously   meant   remark   ,   according   to   which   Boole   ’s   Laws  <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> of </span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> Thought </span></span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> 1854 </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span></span>  was   <br> </br>
   ‘   the   first   book   ever   written   on   mathematics’.2   Formalism   denies   the   status   of   mathematics   to   most   of   what   has   been   commonly   understood   to   be   mathematics   ,   <br> </br>
   and   can   say   nothing   about   its   growth   .   None   of   the   ‘   creative   ’   periods   and   hardly   any   of   the   ‘   critical   ’   periods   of   mathematical   theories   would   be   admitted   <br> </br>
   into   the   formalist   heaven   ,   where   mathematical   theories   dwell   like   the   seraphim   ,   purged   of   all   the   impurities   of   earthly   uncertainty   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Formalists   ,   though   ,   usually   leave   open   a   small   back   door   for   fallen   angels   :   if   it   turns   out   that   for   some   ‘   mixtures   of   mathematics   and   something   else   ’   we   <br> </br>
   can   find   formal   systems   ‘   which   include   them   in   a   certain   sense   ’   ,   then   they   too   may   be   admitted  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Curry </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> [   1951   ]   ,   pp   .   567   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>

   On   those   terms   Newton   had   to   wait   four   centuries   until   Peano   ,   Russell   ,   and   Quine   helped   him   into   heaven   by   formalising   the   Calculus   .   Dirac   is   more   <br> </br>
   fortunate   :   Schwartz   saved   his   soul   during   his   lifetime   .   Perhaps   we   should   mention   here   the   paradoxical   plight   of   the   metamathematician   :   by   formalist   ,   <br> </br>
   or   even   by   deductivist   ,   standards   ,   he   is   not   an   honest   mathematician   .   Dieudonn   talks   about   ‘   the   absolute   necessity   imposed   on   any   mathematician   who   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Under   the   present   dominance   of   formalism   ,   one   is   tempted   to   paraphrase   Kant   :   the   history   of   mathematics   ,   lacking   the   guidance   of   philosophy   ,   has   become   <br> </br>
   blind   ,   while   the   philosophy   of   mathematics   ,   turning   its   back   on   the   most   intriguing   phenomena   in   the   history   of   mathematics   ,   has   become   empty   .   ‘   <br> </br>
   Formalism   ’   is   a   bulwark   of   logical   positivist   philosophy   .   According   to   logical   positivism   ,   a   statement   is   meaningful   only   if   it   is   either   ‘   tautological   <br> </br>
   ’   or   empirical   .   Since   informal   mathematics   is   neither   ‘   tautological   ’   nor   empirical   ,   it   must   be   meaningless   ,   sheer  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> nonsense.3 </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> 2   Russell </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> [   1901   ] </span>  .   <br> </br>
