 Microsoft   Word   -   Document3   detachment   from   the   actions   or   agents   which   are   their   objects   .   I   want   to   speak   ,   at   least   at   first   ,   of   something   else   :   of   the   <br> </br>
   non-detached   attitudes   and   reactions   of   people   directly   involved   in   transactions   with   each   other   ;   of   the   attitudes   and   reactions   of   offended   parties   <br> </br>
   and   beneficiaries   ;   of   such   things   as   sratitude   ,   resentment   ,   forgiveness   ,   love   ,   and   hurt   feelings   .   Perhaps   something   like   the   issue   between   optimists   <br> </br>
   and   pessimists   arises   in   this   neighbouring   field   too   ;   and   since   this   field   is   less   crowded   with   disputants   ,   the   issue   might   here   be   easier   to   settle   ;   and   if   <br> </br>
   it   is   settled   here   ,   then   it   might   become   easier   to   settle   it   in   the   disputant-crowded   field   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   What   I   have   to   say   consists   largely   of   commonplaces   .   So   my   language   ,   like   that   of   commonplaces   generally   ,   will   be   quite   unscientific   and   imprecise   .   The   <br> </br>
   central   commonplace   that   I   want   to   insist   on   is   the   very   great   importance   that   we   attach   to   the   attitudes   and   intentions   towards   us   of   other   human   beings   ,   <br> </br>
   and   the   great   extent   to   which   our   personal   feelings   and   reactions   depend   upon   ,   or   involve   ,   our   beliefs   about   these   attitudes   and   intentions   .   I   can   give   no   <br> </br>
   simple   description   of   the   field   of   phenomena   at   the   centre   of   which   stands   this   commonplace   truth   ;   for   the   field   is   too   complex   .   <br> </br>

   There   are   simplifying   styles   of   handling   it   in   a   general   way   .   Thus   we   may   ,   like   La   Rochefoucauld   ,   put   self-love   or   self-esteem   or   vanity   at   the   centre   of   the   <br> </br>

   need   for   love   ,   and   the   loss   of   security   which   results   from   its   withdrawal   ;   or   ,   in   another   ,   of   human   self-respect   and   its   connection   with   the   recognition   of   <br> </br>

   Besides   resentment   and   gratitude   ,   I   mentioned   just   now   forgiveness   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="subject level2 subject2"> This </span> <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> is   a   rather   unfashionable   subject   in </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> moral </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> philosophy   at   present </span></span>  <br> </br>
   ;   but  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> to   be   forgiven </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   something   we   sometimes   ask </span>  ,   and  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> forgiving </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   something   we   sometimes   say   we   do </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   ask   to   be   forgiven   is   in   part   to   acknowledge   that   the   attitude   displayed   in   our   actions   was   such   as   might   properly   be   resented   and   in   part   to   repudiate   that   <br> </br>
   attitude   for   the   future   (   or   at   least   for   the   immediate   future   )   ;   and   to   forgive   is   to   accept   the   repudiation   and   to   forswear   the   resentment   .   We   should   think   <br> </br>
   of   the   many   different   kinds   of   relationship   which   we   can   have   with   other   peopleas   sharers   of   a   common   interest   ;   as   members   of   the   same   family   ;   as   colleagues   <br> </br>
   ;   as   friends   ;   as   lovers   ;   as   chance   parties   to   an   enormous   range   of   transactions   and   encounters   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Then   we   should   think   ,   in   each   of   these   connections   in   turn   ,   and   in   others   ,   of   the   kind   of   importance   we   attach   to   the   attitudes   and   intentions   towards   us   of   <br> </br>
   those   who   stand   The   second   group   of   considerations   is   very   different   .   I   shall   take   them   in   two   subgroups   of   which   the   first   is   far   less   important   than   the   <br> </br>
   second   .   In   connection   with   the   first   subgroup   we   may   think   of   such   statements   as   ‘   He   was   n’t   himself   ’   ,   ‘   He   has   been   under   very   great   strain   recently   ’   ,   ‘   He   <br> </br>
   was   acting   under   post-hypnotic   suggestion   ’   ;   in   connection   with   the   second   ,   we   may   think   of   ‘   He   ’s   only   a   child   ’   ,   ‘   He   ’s   a   hopeless   schizophrenic   ’   ,   ‘   His   <br> </br>
   mind   has   been   systematically   perverted   ’   ,   ‘   That   ’s   purely   compulsive   behaviour   on   his   part   ’   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Such   pleas   as   these   do   ,   as   pleas   of   my   first   general   group   do   not   ,   invite   us   to   suspend   our   ordinary   reactive   attitudes   towards   the   agent   ,   either   at   the   time   <br> </br>
   of   his   action   or   all   the   time   .   They   do   not   invite   us   to   see   the   agent   ’s   action   in   a   way   consistent   with   the   full   retention   of   ordinary   inter-personal   <br> </br>
   attitudes   and   merely   inconsistent   with   one   particular   attitude   .   They   invite   us   to   view   the   agent   himself   in   a   different   light   from   the   light   in   which   we   <br> </br>
   should   normally   view   one   who   has   acted   as   he   has   acted   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   shall   not   linger   over   the   first   subgroup   of   cases   .   Though   they   perhaps   raise   ,   in   the   short   term   ,   questions   akin   to   those   raised   ,   in   the   long   term   ,   by   the   <br> </br>
   second   subgroup   ,   we   may   dismiss   them   without   considering   those   questions   by   taking   that   admirably   suggestive   phrase   ,   ‘   He   was   n’t   himself   ’   ,   with   the   <br> </br>
   seriousness   that   for   all   its   being   logically   comicit   deserves   .   We   shall   not   feel   resentment   against   the   man   he   is   for   the   action   done   by   the   man   he   is   not   ;   or   <br> </br>
   at   least   we   shall   feel   less   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   normally   have   to   deal   with   him   under   normal   stresses   ;   so   we   shall   not   feel   towards   him   ,   when   he   acts   as   he   does   under   abnormal   stresses   ,   as   we   should   have   <br> </br>
   felt   towards   him   had   he   acted   as   he   did   under   normal   stresses   .   The   second   and   more   important   subgroup   of   cases   allows   that   the   circumstances   were   normal   ,   <br> </br>
   but  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> presents   the   agent   as   psychologically   abhormalor   as   morally   undeveloped   .   The   agent   was   himself   ;   but   he   is   warped   or   deranged   ,   neurotic   or   just   a   child </span>  <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   we   see   someone   in   such   a   light   as   this   ,   all   our   reactive   attitudes   tend   to   be   profoundly   modified   .   I   must   deal   here   in   crude   dichotomies   and   ignore   the   <br> </br>
   ever-interesting   and   ever-illuminating   varieties   of   case   .   What   I   want   to   contrast   is   the   attitude   (   or   range   of   attitudes   )   of   involvement   or   <br> </br>
   participation   in   a   human   relationship   ,   on   the   one   hand   ,   and   what   might   be   called   the   objective   attitude   (   or   range   of   attitudes   )   to   another   human   being   ,   on   <br> </br>
   the   other   .   Even   in   the   same   situation   ,   I   must   add   ,   they   are   not   altogether   exclusive   of   each   other   ;   but   they   are   ,   profoundly   ,   opposed   to   each   other   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   adopt   the   objective   attitude   to   another   human   being   is   to   see   him   ,   perhaps   ,   as   an   object   of   social   policy   ;   as   a   sub   ject   for   what   ,   in   a   wide   range   of   sense   ,   <br> </br>
   might   be   called   treatment   ;   as   something   certainly   to   be   taken   account   ,   perhaps   precautionary   account   ,   of   ;   to   be   managed   or   handled   or   cured   or   trained   ;   <br> </br>
   perhaps   simply   to   be   avoided   ,   though   this   gerundive   is   not   peculiar   to   cases   of   objectivity   of   attitude   .   The   objective   attitude   may   be   emotionally   toned   <br> </br>
   in   many   ways   ,   but   not   in   all   ways   :   it   may   include   repulsion   or   fear   ,   it   may   include   pity   or   even   love   ,   though   not   all   kinds   of   love   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   it   can   not   include   the   range   of   reactive   feelings   and   attitudes   which   belong   to   involvement   or   participation   with   others   in   inter-personal   human   <br> </br>
   relationships   ;   it   can   not   include   resentment   ,   gratitude   ,   forgiveness   ,   anger   ,   or   the   sort   of   love   which   two   adults   can   sometimes   be   said   to   feel   <br> </br>
   reciprocally   ,   for   each   other   .   If   your   attitude   towards   someone   is   wholly   objective   ,   then   though   you   may   light   him   ,   you   can   not   quarrel   with   him   ,   and   though   <br> </br>
   you   may   talk   to   him   ,   even   negotiate   with   him   ,   you   can   not   reason   with   him   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   You   can   at   most   pretend   to   quarrel   ,   or   to   reason   ,   with   him   .   Seeing   someone   ,   then   ,   as   warped   or   deranged   or   compulsive   in   behaviour   or   peculiarly   <br> </br>
   unfortunate   in   his   formative   circumstancesseeing   someone   so   tends   ,   at   least   to   some   extent   ,   to   set   him   apart   from   normal   participant   reactive   attitudes   <br> </br>
   on   the   part   of   one   who   so   sees   him   ,   tends   to   promote   ,   at   least   in   the   civilized   ,   objective   attitudes   .   But   there   is   something   curious   to   add   to   this   .   The   <br> </br>
   objective   attitude   is   not   only   something   we   naturally   tend   to   fall   into   in   cases   like   these   ,   where   participant   attitudes   are   partially   or   wholly   <br> </br>
   inhibited   by   abnormalities   or   by   immaturity   ,   It   is   also   something   which   is   available   as   a   resource   in   other   cases   too   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   look   with   an   objective   eye   on   the   compulsive   behaviour   of   the   normal   (   those   we   rate   as   ‘   normal   ’   )   in   the   objective   way   in   which   we   have   learned   to   look   on   <br> </br>
   certain   classified   cases   of   abnormality   .   And   our   question   reduces   to   this   :   could   ,   or   should   ,   the   acceptance   of   the   determinist   thesis   lead   us   always   to   <br> </br>
   look   on   everyone   exclusively   in   this   way   ?   For   this   is   the   only   condition   worth   considering   under   which   the   acceptancc   of   determinism   could   lead   to   the   <br> </br>
   decay   or   repudiation   of   participant   reactive   attitudes   .   It   does   not   seem   to   be   self-contradictory   to   suppose   that   this   might   happen   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   I   suppose   we   must   say   that   it   is   not   absolutely   inconceivable   that   it   should   happen   .   But   I   am   strongly   inclined   to   think   that   it   is   ,   for   us   as   we   are   ,   <br> </br>
   practically   inconceivable   .   The   human   commitment   to   participation   in   ordinary   inter-personal   relationships   is   ,   I   think   ,   too   thoroughgoing   and   deeply   <br> </br>
   rooted   for   us   to   take   seriously   the   thought   that   a   general   theoretical   conviction   might   so   change   our   world   that   ,   in   it   ,   there   were   no   longer   any   such   things   <br> </br>
   as   inter-personal   relationships   as   we   normally   understand   them   ;   and   being   involved   in   inter-personal   relationships   as   we   normally   understand   them   <br> </br>
   precisely   is   being   exposed   to   the   range   of   reactive   attitudes   and   feelings   that   is   in   question   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   ,   then   ,   is   a   part   of   the   reply   to   our   question   .   A   sustained   objectivity   of   inter-personal   attitude   ,   and   the   human   isolation   which   that   would   entail   ,   <br> </br>
   does   not   seem   to   be   something   of   which   human   beings   would   be   capable   ,   even   if   some   general   truth   were   a   theoretical   ground   for   it   .   But   this   is   not   all   .   There   is   <br> </br>
   a   further   point   ,   implicit   in   the   foregoing   ,   which   must   be   made   explicit   .   Exceptionally   ,   I   have   said   ,   we   can   have   direct   dealings   with   human   beings   without   <br> </br>
   any   degree   of   personal   involvement   ,   treating   them   simply   as   creatures   to   be   handled   in   our   own   interest   ,   or   our   side   ’s   ,   or   society’sor   even   theirs   .   <br> </br>

   In   the   extreme   case   of   the   mentally   deranged   ,   it   is   easy   to   see   the   connection   between   the   possibility   of   a   wholly   objective   attitude   and   the   impossibility   <br> </br>
   of   what   we   understand   by   ordinary   interpersonal   relationships   .   Given   this   latter   impossibility   ,   no   other   civilized   attitude   is   available   than   that   of   <br> </br>
   viewing   the   deranged   person   simply   as   something   to   be   understood   and   controlled   in   the   most   desirable   fashion   .   To   view   him   as   outside   the   reach   of   personal   <br> </br>
   relationships   is   already   ,   for   the   civilized   ,   to   view   him   in   this   way   .   For   reasons   of   policy   or   self-protection   we   may   have   occasion   ,   perhaps   temporary   ,   to   <br> </br>
   adopt   a   fundamentally   similar   attitude   to   a   ‘   normal   ’   human   being   ;   to   concentrate   ,   that   is   ,   on   understanding   ‘   how   he   works   ’   ,   with   a   view   to   determining   our   <br> </br>
   policy   accordingly   ,   or   to   finding   in   that   very   understanding   a   relief   from   the   strains   of   involvement   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Now   it   is   certainly   true   that   <br> </br>

   But   there   is   something   else   which   ,   because   this   is   true   ,   is   equally   certainly   not   true   .   And   that   is   that   there   is   a   sense   of   ‘   determined   ’   such   that   (   1   )   if   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   and   (   3   )   our   adoption   of   the   objective   attitude   towards   the   abnormal   is   the   result   of   a   prior   embracing   of   the   belief   that   the   behaviour   ,   or   the   relevant </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Neither   in   the   case   of   the   normal   ,   then   ,   nor   in   the   case   of   the   abnormal   is   it   true   that   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> when   we   adopt   an </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> objective   attitude </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   we   do   so   because   we   hold   such   a </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   So   my   answer   has   two   parts   .   The   first   is   that   we   can   not   ,   as   we   are   ,   seriously   envisage   ourselves   adopting   a   thoroughgoing   objectivity   of   attitude   to   others   <br> </br>
   as   a   result   of   theoretical   conviction   of   the   truth   of   determinism   ;   and   the   second   is   that   when   we   do   in   fact   adopt   such   an   attitude   in   a   particular   case   ,   our   <br> </br>
   doing   so   is   not   the   consequence   of   a   theoretical   conviction   which   might   be   expressed   as   ‘   Determinism   in   this   case   ’   ,   but   is   a   consequence   of   our   abandoning   ,   <br> </br>
   for   different   reasons   in   different   cases   ,   the   ordinary   inter-personal   attitudes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   might   be   said   that   all   this   leaves   the   real   question   unanswered   ,   and   that   we   can   not   hope   to   answer   it   without   knowing   exactly   what   the   thesis   of   <br> </br>
   determinism   is   .   For   the   real   question   is   not   a   question   about   what   we   actually   do   ,   or   why   we   do   it   .   It   is   not   even   a   question   about   what   we   would   in   fact   do   if   a   <br> </br>
   certain   theoretical   conviction   gained   general   acceptance   .   It   is   a   question   about   what   it   would   be   rational   to   do   if   determinism   were   true   ,   a   question   <br> </br>
   about   the   rational   justification   of   ordinary   inter-personal   attitudes   in   general   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   this   I   shall   reply   ,   first   ,   that   such   a   question   could   seem   real   only   to   one   who   had   utterly   failed   to   grasp   the   purport   .   of   the   preceding   answer   ,   the   fact   of   <br> </br>
   our   natural   human   commitment   to   ordinary   inter-personal   attitudes   .   This   commitment   is   part   of   the   general   framework   of   human   life   ,   not   something   that   <br> </br>
   can   come   up   for   review   as   particular   cases   can   come   up   for   review   within   this   general   framework   .   And   I   shall   reply   ,   second   ,   that   if   we   could   imagine   what   we   <br> </br>
   can   not   have   ,   viz   ,   a   choice   in   this   matter   ,   then   we   could   choose   rationally   only   in   the   light   of   an   assessment   of   the   gains   and   losses   to   human   life   ,   its   <br> </br>
   enrichment   or   impoverishment   ;   and   the   truth   or   falsity   of   a   general   thesis   of   determinism   would   not   bear   on   the   rationality   of   this   choice.(4   )   5   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   point   of   this   discussion   of   the   reactive   attitudes   in   their   relation   --   or   lack   of   itto   the   thesis   of   determinism   was   to   bring   us   ,   if   possible   ,   nearer   to   a   <br> </br>
   position   of   compromise   in   a   more   usual   area   of   debate   .   We   are   not   now   to   discuss   reactive   attitudes   which   are   essentially   those   of   offended   parties   or   <br> </br>
   beneficiaries   .   We   are   to   discuss   reactive   attitudes   which   are   essentially   not   those   ,   or   only   incidentally   are   those   ,   of   offended   parties   or   <br> </br>
   beneficiaries   ,   but   are   nevertheless   ,   I   shall   claim   ,   kindred   attitudes   to   those   I   have   discussed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   put   resentment   in   the   centre   of   the   previous   discussion   .   I   shall   put   moral   indignationor   ,   more   weakly   ,   moral   disapprobationin   the   centre   of   this   one   .   <br> </br>
   The   reactive   attitudes   I   have   so   far   discussed   are   essentially   reactions   to   the   quality   of   others   ’   wills   towards   us   ,   as   manifested   in   their   behaviour   :   to   <br> </br>
   their   good   or   ill   will   or   indifference   or   lack   of   concern   .   Thus   resentment   ,   or   what   I   have   called   resentment   ,   is   a   reaction   to   injury   or   indifference   .   The   <br> </br>
   reactive   attitudes   I   have   now   to   discuss   might   be   described   as   the   sympathetic   or   vicarious   or   impersonal   or   disinterested   or   generalized   analogues   of   <br> </br>
   the   reactive   attitudes   I   have   already   discussed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   ,   are   reactions   to   the   qualities   of   others   ’   wills   ,   not   towards   ourselves   ,   but   towards   others   .   Because   of   this   impersonal   or   vicarious   character   ,   we   <br> </br>
   give   them   different   names   .   Thus   one   who   experiences   the   vicarious   analogue   of   resentment   is   said   to   be   indignant   or   disapproving   ,   or   morally   indignant   or   <br> </br>
   disapproving   .   What   we   have   here   is   ,   as   it   were   ,   resentment   on   behalf   of   another   ,   where   one   ’s   own   interest   and   dignity   are   not   involved   ;   and   it   is   this   <br> </br>
   impersonal   or   vicarious   character   of   the   attitude   ,   added   to   its   others   ,   which   entitle   it   to   the   qualification   ‘   moral   ’   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Both   my   description   of   ,   and   my   name   for   ,   these   attitudes   are   ,   in   one   important   respect   ,   a   little   misleading   .   It   is   not   that   these   attitudes   are   essentially   <br> </br>
   vicariousone   can   feel   indignation   on   one   ’s   own   accountbut   that   they   are   essentially   capable   of   being   vicarious   .   But   I   shall   retain   the   name   for   the   sake   of   <br> </br>
   its   suggestiveness   ;   and   I   hope   that   what   is   misleading   about   it   will   be   corrected   in   what   follows   .   The   personal   reactive   attitudes   rest   on   ,   and   reflect   ,   an   <br> </br>
   expectation   of   ,   and   demand   for   ,   the   manifestation   of   a   certain   degree   of   goodwill   or   regard   on   the   part   of   other   human   beings   towards   ourselves   ;   or   at   least   <br> </br>
   on   the   expectation   of   ,   and   demand   for   ,   an   absence   of   the   manifestation   of   active   ill   will   or   indifferent   disregard   .   <br> </br>

   The   generalized   and   non-generalized   forms   of   demand   ,   and   the   vicarious   and   personal   reactive   attitudes   which   rest   upon   ,   and   reflect   ,   them   are   connected   <br> </br>
   not   merely   logically   .   They   are   connected   humanly   ;   and   not   merely   with   each   other   .   They   are   connected   also   with   yet   another   set   of   attitudes   which   I   must   <br> </br>
   mention   now   in   order   to   complete   the   picture   .   I   have   considered   from   two   points   of   view   the   demands   we   make   on   others   and   our   reactions   to   their   possibly   <br> </br>
   injurious   actions   .   These   were   the   points   of   view   of   one   whose   interest   was   directly   involved   (   who   suffers   ,   say   ,   the   injury   )   and   of   others   whose   interest   <br> </br>
   was   not   directly   involved   (   who   do   not   themselves   suffer   the   injury   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   I   have   spoken   of   personal   reactive   attitudes   in   the   first   connection   and   of   their   vicarious   analogues   in   the   second   .   But   the   picture   is   not   cornplete   <br> </br>
   unless   we   consider   also   the   correlates   of   these   attitudes   on   the   part   of   those   on   whom   the   demands   are   made   ,   on   the   part   of   the   agents   .   Just   as   there   are   <br> </br>
   personal   .   and   vicarious   reactive   attitudes   associated   with   demands   on   others   for   oneself   and   demands   on   others   for   others   ,   so   there   are   self-reactive   <br> </br>
   attitudes   associated   with   demands   on   oneself   for   others   .   And   here   we   have   to   mention   such   phenomena   as   feeling   bound   or   obliged   (   the   ‘   sense   of   obligation   ’   <br> </br>
   )   ;   feeling   compunction   ;   feeling   guilty   or   remorseful   or   at   least   responsible   ;   and   the   more   complicated   phenomenon   of   shame   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   All   these   three   types   of   attitude   are   humanly   connected   .   One   who   manifested   the   personal   reactive   attitudes   in   a   high   degree   but   showed   no   inclination   at   <br> </br>
   all   to   their   vicarious   analogues   would   appear   as   an   abnormal   case   of   moral   egocentricity   ,   as   a   kind   of   moral   solipsist   .
