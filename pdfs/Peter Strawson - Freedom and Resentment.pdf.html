 Microsoft   Word   -   Document3   P.   F.   STRAWSON   :   FREEDOM   AND   RESENTMENT   1   .   Some   philosophers   say   they   do   not   know   what   the   thesis   of   determinism   is   .   Others   say   ,   <br> </br>
   or   imply   ,   that   they   do   know   what   it   is   .   Of   these   ,   somethe   pessimists   perhapshold   that   if   the   thesis   is   true   ,   then   the   concepts   of   moral   obligation   and   <br> </br>
   responsibility   really   have   no   application   ,   and   the   practices   of   punishing   and   blaming   ,   of   expressing   moral   condemnation   and   approval   ,   are   really   <br> </br>
   unjustified   .   Othersthe   optimists   perhapshold   that   these   concepts   and   practices   in   no   way   lose   their   raison   d’tre   if   the   thesis   of   determinism   is   true   .   <br> </br>
   Some   hold   even   that   the   justification   of   these   concepts   and   practices   requires   the   truth   of   the   thesis   .   There   is   another   opinion   which   is   less   frequently   <br> </br>
   voiced   :   the   opinion   ,   it   might   be   said   ,   of   the   genuine   moral   sceptic   .   This   is   that   the   notions   of   moral   guilt   ,   of   blame   ,   of   moral   responsibility   are   <br> </br>
   inherently   confused   and   that   we   can   see   this   to   be   so   if   we   consider   the   consequences   either   of   the   truth   of   determinism   or   of   its   falsity   .   The   holders   of   this   <br> </br>
   opinion   agree   with   the   pessimists   that   these   notions   lack   application   if   determinism   is   true   ,   and   add   simply   that   they   also   lack   it   if   determinism   is   false   <br> </br>
   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   I   am   asked   which   of   these   parties   I   belong   to   ,   I   must   say   it   is   the   first   of   all   ,   the   party   of   those   who   do   not   know   what   the   thesis   of   determinism   is   .   But   this   <br> </br>
   does   not   stop   me   from   having   some   sympathy   with   the   others   ,   and   a   wish   to   reconcile   them   .   Should   not   ignorance   ,   rationally   ,   inhibit   such   sympathies   ?   Well   ,   <br> </br>
   of   course   ,   though   darkling   ,   one   has   some   inklingsome   notion   of   what   sort   of   thing   is   being   talked   about   .   This   lecture   is   intended   as   a   move   towards   <br> </br>
   reconciliation   so   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   is   likely   to   seem   wrongheaded   to   everyone   .   But   can   there   be   any   possibility   of   reconciliation   between   such   clearly   opposed   positions   as   those   of   <br> </br>
   pessimists   and   optimists   about   determinism   ?   Well   ,   there   might   be   a   formal   withdrawal   on   one   side   in   return   for   a   substantial   concession   on   the   other   .   Thus   <br> </br>
   ,   suppose   the   optimist   ’s   position   were   put   like   this   :   (   1   )   the   facts   as   we   know   them   do   not   show   determinism   to   be   false   (   2   )   the   facts   as   we   know   them   supply   an   <br> </br>
   adequate   basis   for   the   concepts   and   practices   which   the   pessimist   feels   to   be   imperilled   by   the   possibility   of   determinism   ’s   truth   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Now   it   might   be   that   the   optimist   is   right   in   this   ,   but   is   apt   to   give   an   inadequate   account   of   the   facts   as   we   know   them   ,   and   of   how   they   constitute   an   adequate   <br> </br>
   basis   for   the   problematic   concepts   and   practices   that   the   reasons   he   gives   for   the   adequacy   of   the   basis   are   themselves   inadequate   and   leave   out   something   <br> </br>
   vital   .   It   might   be   that   the   pessimist   is   rightly   anxious   to   get   this   vital   thing   back   and   ,   in   the   grip   of   his   anxiety   ,   feels   he   has   to   go   beyond   the   facts   as   we   <br> </br>
   know   them   feels   that   the   vital   thing   can   be   secure   only   if   ,   beyond   the   facts   as   we   know   them   ,   there   is   the   further   fact   that   determinism   is   false   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Might   he   not   be   brought   to   make   a   formal   withdrawal   in   return   for   a   vital   concession   ?   2   .   Let   me   enlarge   very   briefly   on   this   ,   by   way   of   preliminary   only   .   Some   <br> </br>
   optimists   about   determinism   point   to   the   efficacy   of   the   practices   of   punishment   ,   and   of   moral   condemnation   and   approval   ,   in   regulating   behaviour   in   <br> </br>
   socially   desirable   ways   .   (   1   )   In   the   fact   of   their   efficacy   ,   they   suggest   ,   is   an   adequate   basis   for   these   practices   and   this   fact   certainly   does   not   show   <br> </br>
   determinism   to   be   false   .   To   this   the   pessimists   reply   ,   all   in   a   rush   ,   that   just   punishment   and   moral   condemnation   imply   moral   guilt   and   guilt   implies   moral   <br> </br>
   responsibility   and   moral   responsibility   implies   freedom   and   freedom   implies   the   falsity   of   determinism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   And   to   this   the   optimists   are   wo   nt   to   reply   in   turn   that   it   is   true   that   these   practices   require   freedom   in   a   sense   ,   and   the   existence   of   freedom   in   this   sense   <br> </br>
   is   one   of   the   facts   as   we   know   them   .   But   what   ‘   freedom   ’   means   here   is   nothing   but   the   absence   of   certain   conditions   the   presence   of   which   would   make   moral   <br> </br>
   condemnation   or   punishment   inappropriate   .   They   have   in   mind   conditions   like   compulsion   by   another   ,   or   innate   incapacity   ,   or   insanity   ,   or   other   less   <br> </br>
   extreme   forms   of   psychological   disorder   ,   or   the   existence   of   circumstances   in   which   the   making   of   any   other   choice   would   be   morally   inadmissible   or   would   <br> </br>
   be   too   much   to   expect   of   any   man   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   this   list   they   are   constrained   to   add   other   factors   which   ,   without   exactly   being   limitations   of   freedom   ,   may   also   make   moral   condemnation   or   <br> </br>
   punishment   inappropriate   or   mitigate   their   force   :   as   some   forms   of   ignorance   ,   mistake   ,   or   accident   .   And   the   general   reason   why   moral   condemnation   or   <br> </br>
   punishment   are   inappropriate   when   these   factors   or   conditions   are   present   is   held   to   be   that   the   practices   in   question   will   be   generally   efficacious   <br> </br>
   means   of   regulating   behaviour   in   desirable   ways   only   in   cases   where   these   factors   are   not   present   .   Now   the   pessimist   admits   that   the   facts   as   we   know   them   <br> </br>
   include   the   existence   of   freedom   ,   the   occurrence   of   cases   of   free   action   ,   in   the   negative   sense   which   the   optimist   concedes   and   admits   ,   or   rather   insists   ,   <br> </br>
   that   the   existence   of   freedom   in   this   sense   is   compatible   with   the   truth   of   determinism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Then   what   does   the   pessimist   find   missing   ?   When   he   tries   to   answer   this   question   ,   his   language   is   apt   to   alternate   between   the   very   familiar   and   the   very   <br> </br>
   unfamiliar.(2   )   Thus   he   may   say   ,   familiarly   enough   ,   that   the   man   who   is   the   subject   of   justified   punishment   ,   blame   or   moral   condemnation   must   really   <br> </br>
   deserve   it   and   then   add   ,   perhaps   ,   that   ,   in   the   case   at   least   where   he   is   blamed   for   a   positive   act   rather   than   an   omission   ,   the   condition   of   his   really   <br> </br>
   deserving   blame   is   something   that   goes   beyond   the   negative   freedoms   that   the   optimist   concedes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   ,   say   ,   a   genuinely   free   identification   of   the   will   with   the   act   .   And   this   is   the   condition   that   is   incompatible   with   the   truth   of   determinism   .   The   <br> </br>
   conventional   ,   but   conciliatory   ,   optimist   need   not   give   up   yet   .   He   may   say   :   Well   ,   people   often   decide   to   do   things   ,   really   intend   to   do   what   they   do   ,   know   <br> </br>
   just   what   they   ’re   doing   in   doing   it   the   reasons   they   think   they   have   for   doing   what   they   do   ,   often   really   are   their   reasons   and   not   their   rationalizations   .   <br> </br>
   These   facts   ,   too   ,   are   included   in   the   facts   as   we   know   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   this   is   what   you   mean   by   freedomby   the   identification   of   the   will   with   the   act   then   freedom   may   again   be   conceded   .   But   again   the   concession   is   compatible   <br> </br>
   with   the   truth   of   the   determinist   thesis   .   For   it   would   not   follow   from   that   thesis   that   nobody   decides   to   do   anything   that   nobody   ever   does   anything   <br> </br>
   intentionally   that   it   is   false   that   people   sometimes   know   perfectly   well   what   they   are   doing   .   I   tried   to   define   freedom   negatively   .   You   want   to   give   it   a   <br> </br>
   more   positive   look   .   But   it   comes   to   the   same   thing   .   Nobody   denies   freedom   in   this   sense   ,   or   these   senses   ,   and   nobody   claims   that   the   existence   of   freedom   in   <br> </br>
   these   senses   shows   determinism   to   be   false   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   it   is   here   that   the   lacuna   in   the   optimistic   story   can   be   made   to   show   .   For   the   pessimist   may   be   supposed   to   ask   :   But   why   does   freedom   in   this   sense   justify   <br> </br>
   blame   ,   etc   .   ?   You   turn   towards   me   first   the   negative   ,   and   then   the   positive   ,   faces   of   a   freedom   which   nobody   challenges   .   But   the   only   reason   you   have   given   <br> </br>
   for   the   practices   of   moral   condemnation   and   punishment   in   cases   where   this   freedom   is   present   is   the   efficacy   of   these   practices   in   regulating   behaviour   <br> </br>
   in   socially   desirable   ways   .   But   this   is   not   a   sufficient   basis   ,   it   is   not   even   the   right   sort   of   basis   ,   for   these   practices   as   we   understand   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Now   my   optimist   ,   being   the   sort   of   man   he   is   ,   is   not   likely   to   invoke   an   intuition   of   fittingness   at   this   point   .   So   he   really   has   no   more   to   say   .   And   my   pessimist   <br> </br>
   ,   being   the   sort   of   man   he   is   ,   has   only   one   more   thing   to   say   and   that   is   that   the   admissibility   of   these   practices   ,   as   we   understand   them   ,   demands   another   kind   <br> </br>
   of   freedom   ,   the   kind   that   in   turn   demands   the   falsity   of   the   thesis   of   determinism   .   But   might   we   not   induce   the   pessimist   to   give   up   saying   this   by   giving   the   <br> </br>
   optimist   something   more   to   say   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   3   .   I   have   mentioned   punishing   and   moral   condemnation   and   approval   and   it   is   in   connection   with   these   practices   or   attitudes   that   the   issue   between   <br> </br>
   optimists   and   pessimistsor   ,   if   one   is   a   pessimist   ,   the   issue   between   determinists   and   libertariansis   felt   to   be   particularly   important   .   But   it   is   not   of   <br> </br>
   these   practices   and   attitudes   that   I   propose   ,   at   first   ,   to   speak   .   These   practices   or   attitudes   permit   ,   where   they   do   not   imply   ,   a   certain   detachment   from   <br> </br>
   the   actions   or   agents   which   are   their   objects   .   I   want   to   speak   ,   at   least   at   first   ,   of   something   else   :   of   the   non-detached   attitudes   and   reactions   of   people   <br> </br>
   directly   involved   in   transactions   with   each   other   of   the   attitudes   and   reactions   of   offended   parties   and   beneficiaries   of   such   things   as   sratitude   ,   <br> </br>
   resentment   ,   forgiveness   ,   love   ,   and   hurt   feelings   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Perhaps   something   like   the   issue   between   optimists   and   pessimists   arises   in   this   neighbouring   field   too   and   since   this   field   is   less   crowded   with   <br> </br>
   disputants   ,   the   issue   might   here   be   easier   to   settle   and   if   it   is   settled   here   ,   then   it   might   become   easier   to   settle   it   in   the   disputant-crowded   field   .   What   <br> </br>
   I   have   to   say   consists   largely   of   commonplaces   .   So   my   language   ,   like   that   of   commonplaces   generally   ,   will   be   quite   unscientific   and   imprecise   .   The   <br> </br>
   central   commonplace   that   I   want   to   insist   on   is   the   very   great   importance   that   we   attach   to   the   attitudes   and   intentions   towards   us   of   other   human   beings   ,   <br> </br>
   and   the   great   extent   to   which   our   personal   feelings   and   reactions   depend   upon   ,   or   involve   ,   our   beliefs   about   these   attitudes   and   intentions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   can   give   no   simple   description   of   the   field   of   phenomena   at   the   centre   of   which   stands   this   commonplace   truth   for   the   field   is   too   complex   .   Much   <br> </br>
   imaginative   literature   is   devoted   to   exploring   its   complexities   and   we   have   a   large   vocabulary   for   the   purpose   .   There   are   simplifying   styles   of   handling   <br> </br>
   it   in   a   general   way   .   Thus   we   may   ,   like   La   Rochefoucauld   ,   put   self-love   or   self-esteem   or   vanity   at   the   centre   of   the   picture   and   point   out   how   it   may   be   <br> </br>
   caressed   by   the   esteem   ,   or   wounded   by   the   indifference   or   contempt   ,   of   others   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   might   speak   ,   in   another   jargon   ,   of   the   need   for   love   ,   and   the   loss   of   security   which   results   from   its   withdrawal   or   ,   in   another   ,   of   human   self-respect   and   <br> </br>
   its   connection   with   the   recognition   of   the   individual   ’s   dignity   .   These   simplifications   are   of   use   to   me   only   if   they   help   to   emphasize   how   much   we   actually   <br> </br>
   mind   ,   how   much   it   matters   to   us   ,   whether   the   actions   of   other   peopleand   particularly   of   some   other   peoplereflect   attitudes   towards   us   of   goodwill   ,   <br> </br>
   affection   ,   or   esteem   on   the   one   hand   or   contempt   ,   indifference   ,   or   malevolence   on   the   other   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   someone   treads   on   my   hand   accidentally   ,   while   trying   to   help   me   ,   the   pain   may   be   no   less   acute   than   if   he   treads   on   it   in   contemptuous   disregard   of   my   <br> </br>
   existence   or   with   a   malevolent   wish   to   injure   me   .   But   I   shall   generally   feel   in   the   second   case   a   kind   and   degree   of   resentment   that   I   shall   not   feel   in   the   <br> </br>
   first   .   If   someone   ’s   actions   help   me   to   some   benefit   I   desire   ,   then   I   am   benefited   in   any   case   but   if   he   intended   them   so   to   benefit   me   because   of   his   general   <br> </br>
   goodwill   towards   me   ,   I   shall   reasonably   feel   a   gratitude   which   I   should   not   feel   at   all   if   the   benefit   was   an   incidental   consequence   ,   unintended   or   even   <br> </br>
   regretted   by   him   ,   of   some   plan   of   action   with   a   different   aim   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   These   examples   are   of   actions   which   confer   benefits   or   inflict   injuries   over   and   above   any   conferred   or   inflicted   by   the   mere   manifestation   of   attitude   <br> </br>
   and   intention   themselves   .   We   should   consjder   also   in   how   much   of   our   behaviour   the   benefit   or   injury   resides   mainly   or   entirely   in   the   manifestation   of   <br> </br>
   attitude   itself   .   So   it   is   with   good   manners   ,   and   much   of   what   we   call   kindness   ,   on   the   one   hand   with   deliberate   rudeness   ,   studied   indifference   ,   or   insult   on   <br> </br>
   the   other   .   Besides   resentment   and   gratitude   ,   I   mentioned   just   now   forgiveness   .   This   is   a   rather   unfashionable   subject   in   moral   philosophy   at   present   but   <br> </br>
   to   be   forgiven   is   something   we   sometimes   ask   ,   and   forgiving   is   something   we   sometimes   say   we   do   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   ask   to   be   forgiven   is   in   part   to   acknowledge   that   the   attitude   displayed   in   our   actions   was   such   as   might   properly   be   resented   and   in   part   to   repudiate   that   <br> </br>
   attitude   for   the   future   (   or   at   least   for   the   immediate   future   )   and   to   forgive   is   to   accept   the   repudiation   and   to   forswear   the   resentment   .   We   should   think   of   <br> </br>
   the   many   different   kinds   of   relationship   which   we   can   have   with   other   peopleas   sharers   of   a   common   interest   as   members   of   the   same   family   as   colleagues   as   <br> </br>
   friends   as   lovers   as   chance   parties   to   an   enormous   range   of   transactions   and   encounters   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Then   we   should   think   ,   in   each   of   these   connections   in   turn   ,   and   in   others   ,   of   the   kind   of   importance   we   attach   to   the   attitudes   and   intentions   towards   us   of   <br> </br>
   those   who   stand   in   these   relationships   to   us   ,   and   of   the   kinds   of   reactive   attitudes   and   feelings   to   which   we   ourselves   are   prone   .   In   general   ,   we   demand   some   <br> </br>
   degree   of   goodwill   or   regard   on   the   part   of   those   who   stand   in   these   relationships   to   us   ,   though   the   forms   we   require   it   to   take   vary   widely   in   different   <br> </br>
   connections   .   The   range   and   intensity   of   our   reactive   attitudes   towards   goodwill   ,   its   absence   or   its   opposite   vary   no   less   widely   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   mentioned   ,   specifically   ,   resentment   and   gratitude   and   they   are   a   usefully   opposed   pair   .   But   ,   of   course   ,   there   is   a   whole   continuum   of   reactive   <br> </br>
   attitude   and   feeling   stretching   on   both   sides   of   these   andthe   most   comfortable   areain   between   them   .   The   object   of   these   commonplaces   is   to   try   to   keep   <br> </br>
   before   our   minds   something   it   is   easy   to   forget   when   we   are   engaged   in   philosophy   ,   especially   in   our   cool   ,   contemporary   style   ,   viz   .   what   it   is   actually   like   <br> </br>
   to   be   involved   in   ordinary   interpersonal   relationships   ,   ranging   from   the   most   intimate   to   the   most   casual   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   4   .   It   is   one   thing   to   ask   about   the   general   causes   of   these   reactive   attitudes   I   have   alluded   to   it   is   another   to   ask   about   the   variations   to   which   they   are   <br> </br>
   subject   ,   the   particular   conditions   in   which   they   do   or   do   not   seem   natural   or   reasonable   or   appropriate   and   it   is   a   third   thing   to   ask   what   it   would   be   like   ,   <br> </br>
   what   it   is   like   ,   not   to   suffer   them   .   I   am   not   much   concerned   with   the   first   question   but   I   am   with   the   second   and   perhaps   even   more   with   the   third   .   Let   us   <br> </br>
   consider   ,   then   ,   occasions   for   resentment   :   situations   in   which   one   person   is   offended   or   injured   by   the   action   of   another   and   in   whichin   the   absence   of   <br> </br>
   special   considerations   the   offended   person   might   naturally   or   normally   be   expected   to   feel   resentment   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Then   let   us   consider   what   sorts   of   special   considerations   might   be   expected   to   modify   or   mollify   this   feeling   or   remove   it   altogether   .   It   needs   no   saying   <br> </br>
   now   how   multifarious   these   considerations   are   .   But   ,   for   my   purpose   ,   I   think   they   can   be   roughly   divided   into   two   kinds   .   To   the   first   group   belong   all   those   <br> </br>
   which   might   give   occasion   for   the   employment   of   such   expressions   as   ‘   He   did   n’t   mean   to   ’   ,   ‘   He   had   n’t   realized   ’   ,   ‘   He   did   n’t   know   ’   and   also   all   those   which   <br> </br>
   might   give   occasion   for   the   use   of   the   phrase   ‘   He   could   n’t   help   it   ’   ,   when   this   is   supported   by   such   phrases   as   ‘   He   was   pushed   ’   ,   ‘   He   had   to   do   it   ’   ,   ‘   It   was   the   <br> </br>
   only   way   ’   ,   ‘   They   left   him   no   alternative   ’   ,   etc   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Obviously   these   various   pleas   ,   and   the   kinds   of   situations   in   which   they   would   be   appropriate   ,   differ   from   each   other   in   striking   and   important   ways   .   But   <br> </br>
   for   my   present   purpose   they   have   something   still   more   important   in   common   .   None   of   them   invites   us   to   suspend   towards   the   agent   ,   either   at   the   time   of   his   <br> </br>
   action   or   in   general   ,   our   ordinary   reactive   attitudes   .   They   do   not   invite   us   to   view   the   agent   as   one   in   respect   of   whom   these   attitudes   are   in   any   way   <br> </br>
   inappropriate   .   They   invite   us   to   view   the   injury   as   one   in   respect   of   which   a   particular   one   of   these   attitudes   is   inappropriate   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   do   not   invite   us   to   see   the   agent   as   other   than   a   fully   responsible   agent   .   They   invite   us   to   see   the   injury   as   one   for   which   he   was   not   fully   ,   or   at   all   ,   <br> </br>
   responsible   .   They   do   not   suggest   that   the   agent   is   in   any   way   an   inappropriate   object   of   that   kind   of   demand   for   goodwill   or   regard   which   is   reflected   in   our   <br> </br>
   ordinary   reactive   attitudes   .   They   suggest   instead   that   the   fact   of   in   jury   was   not   in   this   case   incompatible   with   that   demand   ’s  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> being   fulfilled   ,   that   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> fact </span>  of   injury   was   quite   consistent   with   the   agent   ’s   attitude   and   intentions   being   just   what   we   demand   they   should   be.(3   )   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   agent   was   just   ignorant   of   the   injury   he   was   causing   ,   or   had   lost   his   balance   through   being   pushed   or   had   reluctantly   to   cause   the   injury   for   reasons   <br> </br>
   which   acceptably   override   his   reluctance   .   The   offering   of   such   pleas   by   the   agent   and   their   acceptance   by   the   sufferer   is   something   in   no   way   opposed   to   ,   or   <br> </br>
   outside   the   context   of   ,   ordinary   inter-personal   relationships   and   the   manifestation   of   ordinary   reactive   attitudes   .   Since   things   go   wrong   and   <br> </br>
   situations   are   complicated   ,   it   is   an   essential   and   integral   element   in   the   transactions   which   are   the   life   of   these   relationships   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   second   group   of   considerations   is   very   different   .   I   shall   take   them   in   two   subgroups   of   which   the   first   is   far   less   important   than   the   second   .   In   <br> </br>
   connection   with   the   first   subgroup   we   may   think   of   such   statements   as   ‘   He   was   n’t   himself   ’   ,   ‘   He   has   been   under   very   great   strain   recently   ’   ,   ‘   He   was   acting   <br> </br>
   under   post-hypnotic   suggestion   ’   in   connection   with   the   second   ,   we   may   think   of   ‘   He   ’s   only   a   child   ’   ,   ‘   He   ’s   a   hopeless   schizophrenic   ’   ,   ‘   His   mind   has   been   <br> </br>
   systematically   perverted   ’   ,   ‘   That   ’s   purely   compulsive   behaviour   on   his   part   ’   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Such   pleas   as   these   do   ,   as   pleas   of   my   first   general   group   do   not   ,   invite   us   to   suspend   our   ordinary   reactive   attitudes   towards   the   agent   ,   either   at   the   time   <br> </br>
   of   his   action   or   all   the   time   .   They   do   not   invite   us   to   see   the   agent   ’s   action   in   a   way   consistent   with   the   full   retention   of   ordinary   inter-personal   <br> </br>
   attitudes   and   merely   inconsistent   with   one   particular   attitude   .   They   invite   us   to   view   the   agent   himself   in   a   different   light   from   the   light   in   which   we   <br> </br>
   should   normally   view   one   who   has   acted   as   he   has   acted   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   shall   not   linger   over   the   first   subgroup   of   cases   .   Though   they   perhaps   raise   ,   in   the   short   term   ,   questions   akin   to   those   raised   ,   in   the   long   term   ,   by   the   <br> </br>
   second   subgroup   ,   we   may   dismiss   them   without   considering   those   questions   by   taking   that   admirably   suggestive   phrase   ,   ‘   He   was   n’t   himself   ’   ,   with   the   <br> </br>
   seriousness   that   for   all   its   being   logically   comicit   deserves   .   We   shall   not   feel   resentment   against   the   man   he   is   for   the   action   done   by   the   man   he   is   not   or   at   <br> </br>
   least   we   shall   feel   less   .   We   normally   have   to   deal   with   him   under   normal   stresses   so   we   shall   not   feel   towards   him   ,   when   he   acts   as   he   does   under   abnormal   <br> </br>
   stresses   ,   as   we   should   have   felt   towards   him   had   he   acted   as   he   did   under   normal   stresses   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> The   second   and   more   important   subgroup   of   cases </span>  <br> </br>
