   the   understanding   of   law   ,   coercion   ,   and   morality   as   different   but   related   social   phenomena   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> Though   it   is   primarily   designed   for   the   student   of </span> <span class="subject level2 subject2"> jurisprudence </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   book   as   an   essay   in   analytical   jurisprudence   ,   for   it   is   concerned   with   the   clarification   of   the   general   framework   oflegal   thought   ,   rather   than   with </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   criticism   of   law   or   legal   policy </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Moreover   ,   at   many   points   ,   I   have   raised   questions   which   may   well   be   said   to   be   about   the   meanings   of   words   .   Thus   I   have   considered   :   how  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> being </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> obliged </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> differs </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> from   having   an   obligation   how   the   statement   that   a   rule   is </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> a   valid   rule   of   law </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> differs   from   a   prediction   of   the   behaviour   of   officials   what   is   meant   by   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> assertion   that   a   social   group   observes   a   rule   and   how   this   differs   from   and   resembles   the   assertion   that   its   members   habitually   do   certain   things </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Indeed   ,   one   of   the   central   themes   of   the   book   is   that   neither   law   nor   any   other   form   of   social   structure   can   be   understood   without   an   appreciation   of   certain   <br> </br>
   crucial   distinctions   between   two   different   kinds   of   statement   ,   which   I   have   called   internal   and   external   and   which   can   both   be   made   whenever   social   rules   <br> </br>
   are   observed   .   Notwithstanding   its   concern   with   analysis   the   book   may   also   be   regarded   as   an   essay   in   descriptive   sociology   for   the   suggestion   that   <br> </br>
   inquiries   into   the   meanings   of   words   merely   throw   light   on   words   is   false   .   Many   important   distinctions   ,   which   are   not   immediately   obvious   ,   between   types   <br> </br>
   of   social   situation   or   relationships   may   best   be   brought   to   light   by   an   examination   of   the   standard   uses   of   the   relevant   expressions   and   of   the   way   in   which   <br> </br>
   these   depend   on   a   social   context   ,   itself   often   left   unstated   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   this   field   of   study   it   is   particularly   true   that   we   may   use   ,   as   Professor   J.   L.   Austin   said   ,   a   sharpened   awareness   of   words   to   sharpen   our   perception   of   the   <br> </br>
   phenomena   .   I   am   heavily   and   obviously   indebted   to   other   writers   indeed   much   of   the   book   is   concerned   with   the   deficiencies   of   a   simple   model   of   a   legal   <br> </br>
   system   ,   constructed   along   the   lines   of   Austins   imperative   theory   .   But   in   the   text   the   reader   will   find   very   few   references   to   other   writers   and   very   few   <br> </br>
   footnotes   .   Instead   ,   he   will   find   at   the   end   of   the   book   extensive   notes   designed   to   be   read   after   each   chapter   here   the   views   expressed   in   the   text   are   <br> </br>
   related   to   those   of   my   predecessors   and   contemporaries   ,   and   suggestions   are   made   as   to   the   way   in   which   the   argument   may   be   further   pursued   in   their   <br> </br>
   writings   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   taken   this   course   ,   partly   because   the   argument   of   the   book   is   a   continuous   one   which   comparison   with   other   theories   would   interrupt   .   But   I   have   also   <br> </br>
   had   a   pedagogic   aim   :   I   hope   that   this   arrangement   may   discourage   the   belief   that   a   book   on   legal   theory   is   primarily   a   book   from   which   one   learns   what   other   <br> </br>
   books   contain   .   So   long   as   this   belief   is   held   by   those   who   write   ,   little   progress   will   be   made   in   the   subject   and   so   long   as   it   is   held   by   those   who   read   ,   the   <br> </br>
   educational   value   of   the   subject   must   remain   very   small   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   have   been   indebted   for   too   long   to   too   many   friends   to   be   capable   now   of   identifying   all   my   obligations </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> But   I   have   a   special   debt   to   acknowledge   to   Mr   A.

   left   of   which   he   would   disapprove   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   owe   to   conversations   with   Mr   G.   A.   Paul   anything   of   value   in   the   political   philosophy   of   this   book   and   in   its   reinterpretation   of   natural   law   ,   and   I   have   to   <br> </br>
   thank   him   for   reading   the   proofs   .   I   am   also   most   grateful   to   Dr   Rupert   Cross   and   Mr   P.   F.   Strawson   ,   who   read   the   text   ,   for   their   beneficial   advice   and   <br> </br>
   criticism   .   WITHIN   a   few   years   of   its   publication   The   Concept   Of   Law   transformed   the   way   jurisprudence   was   understood   and   studied   in   the   English-speaking   <br> </br>
   world   and   beyond   .   Its   enormous   impact   led   to   a   multitude   of   publications   discussing   the   book   and   its   doctrines   ,   and   not   only   in   the   context   of   legal   theory   ,   <br> </br>
   but   in   political   and   moral   philosophy   too   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> For   many   years   Hart   had   it   in   mind   to   add   a   chapter   to   Tlze   Concept   if </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Law </span>  .   He   did   not   wish   to   tinker   with   the   text   whose   influence   has   been   so   great   ,   and   in   <br> </br>
   accordance   with   his   wishes   it   is   here   published   unchanged   ,   except   for   minor   corrections   .   But   he   wanted   to   respond   to   the   many   discussions   of   the   book   ,   <br> </br>
   defending   his   position   against   those   who   misconstrued   it   ,   refuting   unfounded   criticism   ,   and-of   equal   importance   in   his   eyes-conceding   the   force   of   <br> </br>
   justified   criticism   and   suggesting   ways   of   adjusting   the   books   doctrines   to   meet   those   points   .   <br> </br>

   perfectionism   .   It   was   also   due   to   persisting   doubts   about   the   wisdom   of   the   project   ,   and   a   nagging   uncertainty   whether   he   could   do   justice   to   the   vigour   and   <br> </br>
   insight   of   the   theses   of   the   book   as   originally   conceived   .   Nevertheless   ,   and   with   many   interruptions   ,   he   persisted   with   work   on   the   postscript   and   at   the   <br> </br>
   time   of   his   death   the   first   of   the   two   intended   sections   was   nearly   complete   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   J   enifer   Hart   asked   us   to   look   at   the   drafts   and   decide   whether   there   was   anything   publishable   there   our   foremost   thought   was   not   to   let   anything   be   <br> </br>
   published   that   Hart   would   not   have   been   happy   with   .   We   were   ,   therefore   ,   delighted   to   discover   that   for   the   most   part   the   first   section   of   the   postscript   was   <br> </br>
   in   such   a   finished   state   .   We   found   only   hand-written   notes   intended   for   the   second   section   ,   and   they   were   too   fragmentary   and   inchoate   to   be   publishable   .   <br> </br>
   In   contrast   the   first   section   existed   in   several   versions   ,   having   been   typed   ,   revised   ,   retyped   ,   and   rerevised   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Even   the   most   recent   version   was   obviously   not   thought   by   him   to   be   in   a   final   state   .   There   are   numerous   alterations   in   pencil   and   Biro   .   Moreover   ,   Hart   did   <br> </br>
   not   discard   earlier   versions   ,   but   seems   to   have   continued   to   work   on   whichever   version   was   to   hand   .   While   this   made   the   editorial   task   more   difficult   ,   the   <br> </br>
   changes   introduced   over   the   last   two   years   were   mostly   changes   of   stylistic   nuance   ,   which   itself   indicated   that   he   was   essentially   satisfied   with   the   <br> </br>
   text   as   it   was   .   Our   task   was   to   compare   the   alternative   versions   ,   and   where   they   did   not   match   establish   whether   segments   of   text   which   appeared   in   only   one   <br> </br>
   of   them   were   missing   from   the   others   because   he   discarded   them   ,   or   because   he   never   had   one   version   incorporating   all   the   emendations   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   published   text   includes   all   the   emendations   which   were   not   discarded   by   Hart   ,   and   which   appear   in   versions   of   the   text   that   he   continued   to   revise   .   At   <br> </br>
   times   the   text   itself   was   incoherent   .   Often   this   must   have   been   the   result   of   a   misreading   of   a   manuscript   by   the   typist   ,   whose   mistakes   Hart   did   not   always   <br> </br>
   notice   .   At   other   times   it   was   no   doubt   due   to   the   natural   way   in   which   sentences   get   mangled   in   the   course   of   composition   ,   to   be   sorted   out   at   the   final   <br> </br>
   drafting   ,   which   he   did   not   live   to   do   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   these   cases   we   tried   to   restore   the   original   text   ,   or   to   recapture   ,   with   minimum   intervention   ,   Harts   thought   .   One   special   problem   was   presented   by   <br> </br>
   Section   6   (   on   discretion   )   .   We   found   two   versions   of   its   opening   paragraph   ,   one   in   a   copy   which   ended   at   that   point   ,   and   another   in   a   copy   containing   the   rest   <br> </br>
   of   the   section   .   As   the   truncated   version   was   in   a   copy   incorporating   many   of   his   most   recent   revisions   ,   and   was   never   discarded   by   him   ,   and   as   it   is   consonant   <br> </br>
   with   his   general   discussion   in   the   postscript   ,   we   decided   to   allow   both   versions   to   be   published   ,   the   one   which   was   not   continued   appearing   in   an   endnote   .   <br> </br>
  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Hart </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> never   had   the   notes   ,   mostly   references   ,   typed </span>  .   He   had   a   hand-written   version   of   the   notes   ,   the   cues   for   which   were   most   easily   traced   in   the   earliest   <br> </br>
   typed   copy   of   the   main   text   .   Later   he   occasionally   added   references   in   marginal   comments   ,   but   for   the   most   part  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> these </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> were   incomplete   ,   sometimes </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> indicating   no   more   than   the   need   to   trace   the   reference </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Timothy   Endicott   has   checked   all   the   references   ,   traced   all   that   were   incomplete   ,   and   added   references   where   Hart   quoted   Dworkin   or   closely   paraphrased   <br> </br>
   him   without   indicating   a   source   .   Endicott   also   corrected   the   text   where   the   quotations   were   inaccurate   .   In   the   course   of   this   work   ,   which   involved   <br> </br>
   extensive   research   and   resourcefulness   ,   he   has   also   suggested   several   corrections   to   the   main   text   ,   in   line   with   the   editorial   guidelines   set   out   above   ,   <br> </br>
   which   we   gratefully   incorporated   .   There   is   no   doubt   in   our   mind   that   given   the   opportunity   Hart   would   have   further   polished   and   improved   the   text   before   <br> </br>
   publishing   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   we   believe   that   the   published   postscript   contains   his   considered   response   to   many   of   Dworkins   arguments   .   Continuity   of   Law   5   I   2   .   The   Persistence   of   <br> </br>

   systematically   studied   as   a   separate   academic   discipline   .   No   vast   literature   is   dedicated   to   answering   the   questions   What   is   chemistry   ?   <br> </br>

   or   What   is   medicine   ?   ,   as   it   is   to   the   question   What   is   law   ?   <br> </br>

   different   kind   from   those   tendered   to   the   student   oflaw   .   No   one   has   thought   it   illuminating   or   important   to   insist   that   medicine   is   what   doctors   do   about   <br> </br>

   Yet   ,   in   the   case   of   law   ,   things   which   at   first   sight   look   as   strange   as   these   have   often   been   said   ,   and   not   only   said   but   urged   with   eloquence   and   passion   ,   as   if   <br> </br>
   they   were   revelations   of   truths   about   law   ,   long   obscured   by   gross   misrepresentations   of   its   essential   nature   .   What   officials   do   about   disputes   is   ...   the   <br> </br>

   Some   of   them   seem   to   conflict   with   the   most   firmly   rooted   beliefs   and   to   be   easily   refutable   so   that   we   are   tempted   to   reply   ,   Surely   statutes   are   law   ,   at   least   <br> </br>
   one   kind   of   law   even   if   there   are   others   :   Surely   law   can   not   just   mean   what   officials   do   or   courts   will   do   ,   since   it   takes   a   law   to   make   an   official   or   a   court   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   these   seemingly   paradoxical   utterances   were   not   made   by   visionaries   or   philosophers   professionally   concerned   to   doubt   the   plainest   deliverances   <br> </br>
   of   common   sense   .   They   are   the   outcome   of   prolonged   reflection   on   law   made   by   men   who   were   primarily   lawyers   ,   concerned   professionally   either   to   teach   or   <br> </br>
   practise   law   ,   and   in   some   cases   to   administer   it   as   judges   .   Moreover   ,   what   they   said   about   law   actually   did   in   their   time   and   place   increase   our   <br> </br>
   understanding   of   it   .   For   ,   understood   in   their   context   ,   such   statements   are   both   illuminating   and   puzzling   :   they   are   more   like   great   exaggerations   of   <br> </br>
   some   truths   about   law   unduly   neglected   ,   than   cool   definitions   .   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> clear   view   of   the   whole </span>  .   To   this   unending   theoretical   debate   in   books   we   find   a   strange   contrast   in   the   ability   of   most   men   to   cite   ,   with   ease   and   confidence   ,   <br> </br>
   examples   of   law   if   they   are   asked   to   do   so   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Few   Englishmen   are   unaware   that   there   is   a   law   forbidding   murder   ,   or   requiring   the   payment   of   income   tax   ,   or   specifying   what   must   be   done   to   make   a   valid   will   <br> </br>
   .   Virtually   everyone   except   the   child   or   foreigner   coming   across   the   English   word   law   for   the   first   time   could   easily   multiply   such   examples   ,   and   most   <br> </br>
   people   could   do   more   .   They   could   describe   ,   at   least   in   outline   ,   how   to   find   out   whether   something   is   the   law   in   England   they   know   that   there   are   experts   to   <br> </br>
   consult   and   courts   with   a   final   authoritative   voice   on   all   such   questions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Much   more   than   this   is   quite   generally   known   .   Most   educated   people   have   the   idea   that   the   laws   in   England   form   some   sort   of   system   ,   and   that   in   France   or   the   <br> </br>
   United   States   or   Soviet   Russia   and   ,   indeed   ,   in   almost   every   part   of   the   world   which   is   thought   of   as   a   separate   country   there   are   legal   systems   which   are   <br> </br>
   broadly   similar   in   structure   in   spite   of   important   differences   .   Indeed   an   education   would   have   seriously   failed   if   it   left   people   in   ignorance   ofthese   <br> </br>
   facts   ,   and   we   would   hardly   think   it   a   mark   of   great   sophistication   if   those   who   knew   this   could   also   say   what   are   the   important   points   of   similarity   between   <br> </br>
   different   legal   systems   .   <br> </br>

   If   all   this   is   common   knowledge   ,   how   is   it   that   the   question   What   is   law   ?   has   persisted   and   so   many   various   and   extraordinary   answers   have   been   given   to   it   ?   Is   <br> </br>
   it   because   ,   besides   the   clear   standard   cases   constituted   by   the   legal   systems   of   modern   states   ,   which   no   one   in   his   senses   doubts   are   legal   systems   ,   there   <br> </br>
   exist   also   doubtful   cases   ,   and   about   their   legal   quality   not   only   ordinary   educated   men   but   even   lawyers   hesitate   ?   Primitive   law   and   international   law   <br> </br>
   are   the   foremost   of   such   doubtful   cases   ,   and   it   is   notorious   that   many   find   that   there   are   reasons   ,   though   usually   not   conclusive   ones   ,   for   denying   the   <br> </br>
   propriety   of   the   now   conventional   use   of   the   word   law   in   these   cases   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   existence   of   these   questionable   or   challengeable   cases   has   indeed   given   rise   to   a   prolonged   and   somewhat   sterile   controversy   ,   but   surely   they   can   not   <br> </br>
   account   for   the   perplexities   about   the   general   nature   of   law   expressed   by   the   persistent   question   What   is   law   ?   That   these   can   not   be   the   root   of   the   <br> </br>
   difficulty   seems   plain   for   two   reasons   .   First   ,   it   is   quite   obvious   why   hesitation   is   felt   in   these   cases   .   International   law   lacks   a   legislature   ,   states   <br> </br>
   can   not   be   brought   before   international   courts   without   their   prior   consent   ,   and   there   is   no   centrally   organized   effective   system   of   sanctions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Certain   types   of   primitive   law   ,   including   those   out   of   which   some   contemporary   legal   systems   may   have   gradually   evolved   ,   similarly   lack   these   features   ,   <br> </br>
   and   it   is   perfectly   clear   to   everyone   that   it   is   their   deviation   in   these   respects   from   the   standard   case   which   makes   their   classification   appear   <br> </br>
   questionable   .   There   is   no   mystery   about   this   .   Secondly   ,   it   is   not   a   peculiarity   of   complex   terms   like   law   and   legal   system   that   we   are   forced   to   recognize   <br> </br>
   both   clear   standard   cases   and   challengeable   borderline   cases   .   It   is   now   a   familiar   fact   (   though   once   too   little   stressed   )   that   this   distinction   must   be   <br> </br>
   made   in   the   case   of   almost   every   general   term   which   we   use   in   classifying   features   of   human   life   and   of   the   world   in   which   we   live   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Sometimes   the   difference   between   the   clear   ,   standard   case   or   paradigm   for   the   use   of   an   expression   and   the   questionable   cases   is   only   a   matter   of   degree   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Sometimes   the   deviation   from   the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> standard   case </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   not   a   mere   matter   of   degree </span>  but   arises   when   <br> </br>

   ?   Such   questions   may   be   instructive   because   they   force   us   to   reflect   on   ,   and   make   explicit   ,   our   conception   of   the   composition   of   the   standard   case   but   it   is   <br> </br>
   plain   that   what   may   be   called   the   borderline   aspect   of   things   is   too   common   to   account   for   the   long   debate   about   law   .
