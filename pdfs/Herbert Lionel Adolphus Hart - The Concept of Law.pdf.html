   been   to   further   the   understanding   of   law   ,   coercion   ,   and   morality   as   different   but   related   social   phenomena   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Though   it   is   primarily   designed   for   the   student   of   jurisprudence   ,   I   hope   it   may   also   be   of   use   to   those   whose   chief   interests   are   in   moral   or   political   <br> </br>
   philosophy   ,   or   in   sociology   ,   rather   than   in   law   .   The   lawyer   will   regard   the   book   as   an   essay   in   analytical   jurisprudence   ,   for   it   is   concerned   with   the   <br> </br>
   clarification   of   the   general   framework   oflegal   thought   ,   rather   than   with   the   criticism   of   law   or   legal   policy   .   Moreover   ,   at   many   points   ,   I   have   raised   <br> </br>
   questions   which   may   well   be   said   to   be   about   the   meanings   of   words   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   I   have   considered   :   how   being   obliged   differs   from   having   an   obligation   ;   how   the   statement   that   a   rule   is   a   valid   rule   of   law   differs   from   a   prediction   of   <br> </br>
   the   behaviour   of   officials   ;   what   is   meant   by   the   assertion   that   a   social   group   observes   a   rule   and   how   this   differs   from   and   resembles   the   assertion   that   its   <br> </br>
   members   habitually   do   certain   things   .   Indeed   ,   one   of   the   central   themes   of   the   book   is   that   neither   law   nor   any   other   form   of   social   structure   can   be   <br> </br>
   understood   without   an   appreciation   of   certain   crucial   distinctions   between   two   different   kinds   of   statement   ,   which   I   have   called   internal   and   external   <br> </br>
   and   which   can   both   be   made   whenever   social   rules   are   observed   .   <br> </br>
   <span class='indentation'>  </span>  <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level2 subject2"> I </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level2 contrast2"> am   heavily   and   obviously   indebted   to   other   writers </span></span>  <br> </br>
   ;   indeed  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> much   of   the   book </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   concerned   with   the   deficiencies   of   a   simple   model   of   a   legal   system   ,   constructed   along   the   lines   of   Austins   imperative   theory </span>  .   <br> </br>
   But   in   the   text   the   reader   will   find   very   few   references   to   other   writers   and   very   few   footnotes   .   Instead   ,   he   will   find   at   the   end   of   the   book   extensive   notes   <br> </br>
   designed   to   be   read   after   each   chapter   ;   here   the   views   expressed   in   the   text   are   related   to   those   of   my   predecessors   and   contemporaries   ,   and   suggestions   <br> </br>
   are   made   as   to   the   way   in   which   the   argument   may   be   further   pursued   in   their   writings   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   taken   this   course   ,   partly   because   the   argument   of   the   book   is   a   continuous   one   ;  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> which </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> comparison   with   other   theories </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> would   interrupt </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   I   have   also   had   a   pedagogic   aim   :   I   hope   that   this   arrangement   may   discourage   the   belief   that   a   book   on   legal   theory   is   primarily   a   book   from   which   one   <br> </br>
   learns   what   other   books   contain   .   So   long   as   this   belief   is   held   by   those   who   write   ,   little   progress   will   be   made   in   the   subject   ;   and   so   long   as   it   is   held   by   <br> </br>
   those   who   read   ,   the   educational   value   of   the   subject   must   remain   very   small   .   I   have   been   indebted   for   too   long   to   too   many   friends   to   be   capable   now   of   <br> </br>
   identifying   all   my   obligations   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   I   have   a   special   debt   to   acknowledge   to   Mr   A.   M.   Honore   whose   detailed   criticisms   exposed   many   confusions   of   thought   and   infelicities   of   style   .   These   I   <br> </br>
   have   tried   to   eliminate   ,   but   I   fear   that   much   is   left   of   which   he   would   disapprove   .   I   owe   to   conversations   with   Mr   G.   A.   Paul   anything   of   value   in   the   political   <br> </br>
   philosophy   of   this   book   and   in   its   reinterpretation   of   natural   law   ,   and   I   have   to   thank   him   for   reading   the   proofs   .   I   am   also   most   grateful   to   Dr   Rupert   Cross   <br> </br>
   and   Mr   P.   F.   Strawson   ,   who   read   the   text   ,   for   their   beneficial   advice   and   criticism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   WITHIN   a   few   years   of   its   publication   The   Concept   Of   Law   transformed   the   way   jurisprudence   was   understood   and   studied   in   the   English-speaking   world   and   <br> </br>
   beyond   .   Its   enormous   impact   led   to   a   multitude   of   publications   discussing   the   book   and   its   doctrines   ,   and   not   only   in   the   context   of   legal   theory   ,   but   in   <br> </br>
   political   and   moral   philosophy   too   .   When   J   enifer   Hart   asked   us   to   look   at   the   drafts   and   decide   whether   there   was   anything   publishable   there   our   foremost   <br> </br>
   thought   was   not   to   let   anything   be   published   that   Hart   would   not   have   been   happy   with   .   We   were   ,   therefore   ,   delighted   to   discover   that   for   the   most   part   the   <br> </br>
   first   section   of   the   postscript   was   in   such   a   finished   state   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>

   .   There   are   numerous   alterations   in   pencil   and   Biro   .   Moreover   ,   Hart   did   not   discard   earlier   versions   ,   but   seems   to   have   continued   to   work   on   whichever   <br> </br>
   version   was   to   hand   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   While   this   made   the   editorial   task   more   difficult   ,   the   changes   introduced   over   the   last   two   years   were   mostly   changes   of   stylistic   nuance   ,   which   itself   <br> </br>
   indicated   that   he   was   essentially   satisfied   with   the   text   as   it   was   .   Hart   never   had   the   notes   ,   mostly   references   ,   typed   .   He   had   a   hand-written   version   of   <br> </br>
   the   notes   ,   the   cues   for   which   were   most   easily   traced   in   the   earliest   typed   copy   of   the   main   text   .   Later   he   occasionally   added   references   in   marginal   <br> </br>
   comments   ,   but   for   the   most   part   these   were   incomplete   ,   sometimes   indicating   no   more   than   the   need   to   trace   the   reference   .   <br> </br>

   4   Uncertainty   in   the   Rule   of   Recognition   I47   Index   gog   FEw   questions   concerning   human   society   have   been   asked   with   such   persistence   and   answered   by   <br> </br>
   serious   thinkers   in   so   many   diverse   ,   strange   ,   and   even   paradoxical   ways   as   the   question   What   is   law   ?   Even   if   we   confine   our   attention   to   the   legal   theory   of   <br> </br>
   the   last   I   50   years   and   neglect   classical   and   medieval   speculation   about   the   nature   of   law   ,   we   shall   find   a   situation   not   paralleled   in   any   other   subject   <br> </br>
   systematically   studied   as   a   separate   academic   discipline   .   No   vast   literature   is   dedicated   to   answering   the   questions   What   is   chemistry   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   or   What   is   medicine   ?   ,   as   it   is   to   the   question   What   is   law   ?   A   few   lines   on   the   opening   page   of   an   elementary   textbook   is   all   that   the   student   of   these   sciences   is   <br> </br>
   asked   to   consider   ;   and   the   answers   he   is   given   are   of   a   very   different   kind   from   those   tendered   to   the   student   oflaw   .   No   one   has   thought   it   illuminating   or   <br> </br>
   important   to   insist   that   medicine   is   what   doctors   do   about   illnesses   ,   or   a   prediction   of   what   doctors   will   do   ,   or   to   declare   that   what   is   ordinarily   <br> </br>
   recognized   as   a   characteristic   ,   central   part   of   chemistry   ,   say   the   study   of   acids   ,   is   not   really   part   of   chemistry   at   all   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   ,   in   the   case   of   law   ,   things   which   at   first   sight   look   as   strange   as   these   have   often   been   said   ,   and   not   only   said   but   urged   with   eloquence   and   passion   ,   as   if   <br> </br>
   they   were   revelations   of   truths   about   law   ,   long   obscured   by   gross   misrepresentations   of   its   essential   nature   .   ...   If   at   all   existent   ,   the   first   norm   is   <br> </br>
   contained   in   the   second   norm   which   is   the   only   genuine   norm   ....   Law   is   the   primary   norm   which   stipulates   the   sanction   .   These   are   only   a   few   of   many   <br> </br>
   assertions   and   denials   concerning   the   nature   of   law   which   at   first   sight   ,   at   least   ,   seem   strange   and   paradoxical   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Some   of   them   seem   to   conflict   with   the   most   firmly   rooted   beliefs   and   to   be   easily   refutable   ;   so   that   we   are   tempted   to   reply   ,   Surely   statutes   are   law   ,   at   <br> </br>
   least   one   kind   of   law   even   if   there   are   others   :   Surely   law   can   not   just   mean   what   officials   do   or   courts   will   do   ,   since   it   takes   a   law   to   make   an   official   or   a   <br> </br>
   court   .   To   this   unending   theoretical   debate   in   books   we   find   a   strange   contrast   in   the   ability   of   most   men   to   cite   ,   with   ease   and   confidence   ,   examples   of   law   <br> </br>
   if   they   are   asked   to   do   so   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Few </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Englishmen </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> are   unaware   that   there   is   a   law   forbidding   murder   ,   or   requiring   the   payment   of   income   tax   ,   or   specifying   what   must   be   done   to   make   a   valid   will </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> .   Virtually   everyone   except   the   child   or   foreigner   coming   across   the   English   word   law   for   the   first   time   could   easily   multiply   such   examples   ,   and   most </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> They   could   describe   ,   at   least   in   outline   ,   how   to   find   out   whether   something   is   the   law   in </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> England </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ;   they   know   that   there   are   experts   to   consult   and   courts   with </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> a   final   authoritative   voice   on   all   such   questions </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Much   more   than   this   is   quite   generally   known   .   Most   educated   people   have   the   idea   that   the   laws   in   England   form   some   sort   of   system   ,   and   that   in   France   or   the   <br> </br>
   United   States   or   Soviet   Russia   and   ,   indeed   ,   in   almost   every   part   of   the   world   which   is   thought   of   as   a   separate   country   there   are   legal   systems   which   are   <br> </br>
   broadly   similar   in   structure   in   spite   of   important   differences   .   Indeed   an   education   would   have   seriously   failed   if   it   left   people   in   ignorance   ofthese   <br> </br>
   facts   ,   and   we   would   hardly   think   it   a   mark   of   great   sophistication   if   those   who   knew   this   could   also   say   what   are   the   important   points   of   similarity   between   <br> </br>
   different   legal   systems   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Any   educated   man   might   be   expected   to   be   able   to   identify   these   salient   features   in   some   such   skeleton   way   as   follows   .   They   comprise   (   i   )   rules   forbidding   or   <br> </br>
   enjoining   certain   types   of   behaviour   under   penalty   ;   (   ii   )   rules   requiring   people   to   compensate   those   whom   they   injure   in   certain   ways   ;   (   iii   )   rules   <br> </br>
   specifying   what   must   be   done   to   make   wills   ,   contracts   or   other   arrangements   which   confer   rights   and   create   obligations   ;   (   iv   )   courts   to   determine   what   the   <br> </br>
   rules   are   and   when   they   have   been   broken   ,   and   to   fix   the   punishment   or   compensation   to   be   paid   ;   (   v   )   a   legislature   to   make   new   rules   and   abolish   old   ones   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   First   ,   it   is   quite   obvious   why   hesitation   is   felt   in   these   cases   .   International   law   lacks   a   legislature   ,   states   can   not   be   brought   Secondly   ,   it   is   not   a   <br> </br>
   peculiarity   of   complex   terms   like   law   and   legal   system   that   we   are   forced   to   recognize   both   clear   standard   cases   and   challengeable   borderline   cases   .   It   is   <br> </br>
   now   a   familiar   fact   (   though   once   too   little   stressed   )   that   this   distinction   must   be   made   in   the   case   of   almost   every   general   term   which   we   use   in   classifying   <br> </br>
   features   of   human   life   and   of   the   world   in   which   we   live   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Sometimes   the   difference   between   the   clear   ,   standard   case   or   paradigm   for   the   use   of   an   expression   and   the   questionable   cases   is   only   a   matter   of   degree   .   <br> </br>

   Such   questions   may   be   instructive   because   they   force   us   to   reflect   on   ,   and   make   explicit   ,   our   conception   of   the   composition   of   the   standard   case   ;   but   it   is   <br> </br>
   plain   that   what   may   be   called   the   borderline   aspect   of   things   is   too   common   to   account   for   the   long   debate   about   law   .   Moreover   ,   only   a   relatively   small   and   <br> </br>
   unimportant   part   of   the   most   famous   and   controversial   theories   of   law   are   concerned   with   the   propriety   of   using   the   expressions   primitive   law   or   <br> </br>
   international   law   to   describe   the   cases   to   which   they   are   conventionally   applied   .   When   we   reflect   on   the   quite   general   ability   of   people   to   recognize   and   <br> </br>
   cite   examples   of   laws   and   on   how   much   is   generally   known   about   the   standard   case   of   a   legal   system   ,   it   might   seem   that   we   could   easily   put   an   end   to   the   <br> </br>
   persistent   question   ,   What   is   law   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ,   simply   by   issuing   a   series   ofreminders   of   what   is   already   familiar   .   Why   should   we   not   just   repeat   the   skeleton   account   of   the   salient   features   of   a   <br> </br>
   municipal   legal   system   which   ,   perhaps   optimistically   ,   we   put   (   on   page   3   )   into   the   mouth   of   an   educated   man   ?   We   can   then   simply   say   ,   Such   is   the   standard   case   <br> </br>
   of   what   is   meant   by   law   and   legal   system   ;   remember   that   besides   these   standard   cases   you   will   also   find   arrangements   in   social   life   which   ,   while   sharing   <br> </br>
   some   ofthese   salient   features   ,   also   lack   others   of   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   These   are   disputed   cases   where   there   can   be   no   conclusive   argument   for   or   against   their   classification   as   law   .   We   shall   distinguish   here   three   such   <br> </br>
   principal   recurrent   issues   ,   and   show   later   why   they   come   together   in   the   form   of   a   request   for   a   definition   of   law   or   an   answer   to   the   question   What   is   law   ?   ,   or   <br> </br>
   in   more   obscurely   framed   questions   such   as   What   is   the   nature   (   or   the   essence   )   of   law   ?   Two   of   these   issues   arise   in   the   following   way   .   The   most   prominent   <br> </br>
   general   feature   of   law   at   all   times   and   places   is   that   its   existence   means   that   certain   kinds   of   human   conduct   are   no   longer   optional   ,   but   in   some   sense   <br> </br>
   obligatory   .   <br> </br>

   of  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> non-optional </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> obligatory   conduct   we   can   distinguish   different   forms </span>  .   The   first   ,   simplest   sense   in   which   conduct   is   no   longer   optional   ,   is   when   one   man   <br> </br>
   is   forced   to   do   what   another   tells   him   ,   not   because   he   is   physically   compelled   in   the   sense   that   his   body   is   pushed   or   pulled   about   ,   but   because   the   other   <br> </br>
   threatens   him   with   unpleasant   consequences   if   he   refuses   .   The   gunman   orders   his   victim   to   hand   over   his   purse   and   threatens   to   shoot   if   he   refuses   ;   if   the   <br> </br>
   victim   complies   we   refer   to   the   way   in   which   he   was   forced   to   do   so   by   saying   that   he   was   obliged   to   do   so   .   <br> </br>

   A   penal   statute   declaring   certain   conduct   to   be   an   offence   and   specifying   the   punishment   to   which   the   offender   is   liable   ,   may   appear   to   be   the   gunman   <br> </br>
   situation   writ   large   ;   and   the   only   difference   to   be   the   relatively   minor   one   ,   that  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> in   the   case   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> statutes </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   the   orders   are   addressed   generally   to   a   group </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   But   attractive   as   this   reduction   of   the   complex   phenomena   of   law   to   this   simple   element   may   seem   ,   it   has   been   found   ,   when   examined   closely   ,   to   be   a   <br> </br>
   distortion   and   a   source   of   confusion   even   in   the   case   of   a   penal   statute   where   an   analysis   in   these   simple   terms   seems   most   plausible   .   How   then   do   law   and   <br> </br>
   legal   obligation   differ   from   ,   and   how   are   they   related   to   ,   orders   backed   by   threats   ?   This   at   all   times   has   been   one   cardinal   issue   latent   in   the   question   <br> </br>
   What   is   law   ?   .   The   account   which   we   are   at   first   perhaps   naturally   tempted   to   give   of   the   apparently   simple   idea   of   a   mandatory   rule   has   soon   to   be   abandoned   .   <br> </br>
   It   is   that   to   say   that   a   rule   exists   means   only   that   a   group   of   people   ,   or   most   of   them   ,   behave   as   a   rule   i.e.   generally   ,   in   a   specified   similar   way   in   certain   <br> </br>
   kinds   of   circumstances   .   So   to   say   that   in   England   there   is   a   rule   that   a   man   must   not   wear   a   hat   in   church   or   that   one   must   stand   up   when   God   Save   the   Queen   is   <br> </br>
   played   means   ,   on   this   account   of   the   matter   ,   only   that   most   people   generally   do   these   things   .   Plainly   this   is   not   enough   ,   even   though   it   conveys   part   of   what   <br> </br>
   is   meant   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Mere   convergence   in   behaviour   between   members   of   a   social   group   may   exist   (   all   may   regularly   drink   tea   at   breakfast   or   go   weekly   to   the   cinema   )   and   yet   there   <br> </br>
   may   be   no   rule   requiring   it   .   The   difference   between   the   two   social   situations   of   mere   convergent   behaviour   and   the   existence   of   a   social   rule   shows   itself   <br> </br>
   often   linguistically   .   In   describing   the   latter   we   may   ,   though   we   need   not   ,   make   use   of   certain   words   which   would   be   misleading   if   we   meant   only   to   assert   the   <br> </br>
   former   .   These   are   the   words   must   ,   should   ,   and   ought   to   ,   which   in   spite   of   differences   share   certain   common   functions   in   indicating   the   presence   of   a   rule   <br> </br>
   requiring   certain   conduct   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> There </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> in </span></span>  England   no   rule   ,   nor   is   it   true   ,   that   everyone   must   or   ought   to   or   should   go   to   the   cinema   each   week   :   it   is   only   true   that   there   is   regular   resort   to   <br> </br>
   the   cinema   each   week   .   But   there   is   a   rule   that   a   man   must   bare   his   head   in   church   .   What   then   is   the   crucial   difference   between   merely   convergent   habitual   <br> </br>
   behaviour   in   a   social   group   and   the   existence   of   a   rule   of   which   the   words   must   ,   should   ,   and   ought   to   are   often   a   sign   ?   Here   indeed   legal   theorists   have   been   <br> </br>
   divided   ,   especially   in   our   own   day   when   several   things   have   forced   this   issue   to   the   front   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> In   the   case   of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> legal </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> rules   it   is   very   often   held   that   the   crucial   difference   (   the   element   of   must   or   ought   )   consists   in   the   fact   that   deviations   from   certain </span>  <br> </br>

   .   Yet   among   critics   who   have   pressed   these   objections   to   the   predictive   account   some   confess   that   there   is   something   obscure   here   ;   something   which   <br> </br>
   resists   analysis   in   clear   ,   hard   ,   factual   terms   .   What   can   there   be   in   a   rule   apart   from   regular   and   hence   predictable   punishment   or   reproof   of   those   who   <br> </br>
   deviate   from   the   usual   patterns   of   conduct   ,   which   distinguishes   it   from   a   mere   group   habit   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Can   there   really   be   something   over   and   above   these   clear   ascertainable   facts   ,   some   extra   element   ,   which   guides   the   judge   and   justifies   or   gives   him   a   <br> </br>
   reason   for   punishing   ?   The   difficulty   of   saying   what   exactly   this   extra   element   is   has   led   these   critics   of   the   predictive   theory   to   insist   at   this   point   <br> </br>
   that   all   talk   of   rules   ,   and   the   corresponding   use   of   words   like   must   ,   ought   ,   and   should   ,   is   fraught   with   a   confusion   which   perhaps   enhances   their   <br> </br>
   importance   in   mens   eyes   but   has   no   rational   basis   .   We   merely   think   ,   so   such   critics   claim   ,   that   there   is   something   in   the   rule   which   binds   us   to   do   certain   <br> </br>
   things   and   guides   or   justifies   us   in   doing   them   ,   but   this   is   an   illusion   even   if   it   is   a   useful   one   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   All   that   there   is   ,   over   and   above   the   clear   ascertainable   facts   of   group   behaviour   and   predictable   reaction   to   deviation   ,   are   our   own   powerful   feelings   of   <br> </br>
   compulsion   to   behave   in   accordance   with   the   rule   and   to   act   against   those   who   do   not   .   We   do   not   recognize   these   feelings   for   what   they   are   but   imagine   that   <br> </br>
   there   is   something   external   ,   some   invisible   part   of   the   fabric   of   the   universe   guiding   and   controlling   us   in   these   activities   .   We   are   here   in   the   realm   of   <br> </br>
   fiction   ,   with   which   it   is   said   the   law   has   always   been   connected   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   only   because   we   adopt   this   fiction   that   we   can   talk   solemnly   of   the   government   of   laws   not   men   .
