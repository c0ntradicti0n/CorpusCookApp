   available   Printed   in   Great   Britain   on   acidjree   paper   by   Biddies   Ltd.   ,   Guildford   and   Kings   Lynn   MY   aim   in   this   book   has   been   to   further   the   understanding   of   <br> </br>
   law   ,   coercion   ,   and   morality   as   different   but   related   social   phenomena   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Though   it   is   primarily   designed   for   the   student   of   jurisprudence   ,   I   hope   it   may   also   be   of   use   to   those   whose   chief   interests   are   in   moral   or   political   <br> </br>
   philosophy   ,   or   in   sociology   ,   rather   than   in   law   .   The   lawyer   will   regard   the   book   as   an   essay   in   analytical   jurisprudence   ,   for   it   is   concerned   with   the   <br> </br>
   clarification   of   the   general   framework   oflegal   thought   ,   rather   than   with   the   criticism   of   law   or   legal   policy   .   Moreover   ,   at   many   points   ,   I   have   raised   <br> </br>
   questions   which   may   well   be   said   to   be   about   the   meanings   of   words   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   I   have   considered   :   how   being   obliged   differs   from   having   an   obligation   how   the   statement   that   a   rule   is   a   valid   rule   of   law   differs   from   a   prediction   of   <br> </br>
   the   behaviour   of   officials   what   is   meant   by   the   assertion   that   a   social   group   observes   a   rule   and   how   this   differs   from   and   resembles   the   assertion   that   its   <br> </br>
   members   habitually   do   certain   things   .   Indeed   ,   one   of   the   central   themes   of   the   book   is   that   neither   law   nor   any   other   form   of   social   structure   can   be   <br> </br>
   understood   without   an   appreciation   of   certain   crucial   distinctions   between   two   different   kinds   of   statement   ,   which   I   have   called   internal   and   external   <br> </br>
   and   which   can   both   be   made   whenever   social   rules   are   observed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Notwithstanding   its   concern   with   analysis   the   book   may   also   be   regarded   as   an   essay   in   descriptive   sociology   for   the   suggestion   that   inquiries   into   the   <br> </br>
   meanings   of   words   merely   throw   light   on   words   is   false   .   Many   important   distinctions   ,   which   are   not   immediately   obvious   ,   between   types   of   social   <br> </br>
   situation   or   relationships   may   best   be   brought   to   light   by   an   examination   of   the   standard   uses   of   the   relevant   expressions   and   of   the   way   in   which   these   <br> </br>
   depend   on   a   social   context   ,   itself   often   left   unstated   .   In   this   field   of   study   it   is   particularly   true   that   we   may   use   ,   as   Professor   J.   L.   Austin   said   ,   a   <br> </br>
   sharpened   awareness   of   words   to   sharpen   our   perception   of   the   phenomena   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   am   heavily   and   obviously   indebted   to   other   writers   indeed   much   of   the   book   is   concerned   with   the   deficiencies   of   a   simple   model   of   a   legal   system   ,   <br> </br>
   constructed   along   the   lines   of   Austins   imperative   theory   .   But   in   the   text   the   reader   will   find   very   few   references   to   other   writers   and   very   few   footnotes   .   <br> </br>
   Instead   ,   he   will   find   at   the   end   of   the   book   extensive   notes   designed   to   be   read   after   each   chapter   here   the   views   expressed   in   the   text   are   related   to   those   of   <br> </br>
   my   predecessors   and   contemporaries   ,   and   suggestions   are   made   as   to   the   way   in   which   the   argument   may   be   further   pursued   in   their   writings   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   taken   this   course   ,   partly   because   the   argument   of   the   book   is   a   continuous   one   which   comparison   with   other   theories   would   interrupt   .   But   I   have   also   <br> </br>
   had   a   pedagogic   aim   :   I   hope   that   this   arrangement   may   discourage   the   belief   that   a   book   on   legal   theory   is   primarily   a   book   from   which   one   learns   what   other   <br> </br>
   books   contain   .   So   long   as   this   belief   is   held   by   those   who   write   ,   little   progress   will   be   made   in   the   subject   and   so   long   as   it   is   held   by   those   who   read   ,   the   <br> </br>
   educational   value   of   the   subject   must   remain   very   small   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   been   indebted   for   too   long   to   too   many   friends   to   be   capable   now   of   identifying   all   my   obligations   .   But   I   have   a   special   debt   to   acknowledge   to   Mr   A.   M.   <br> </br>
   Honore   whose   detailed   criticisms   exposed   many   confusions   of   thought   and   infelicities   of   style   .   These   I   have   tried   to   eliminate   ,   but   I   fear   that   much   is   <br> </br>
   left   of   which   he   would   disapprove   .   I   owe   to   conversations   with   Mr   G.   A.   Paul   anything   of   value   in   the   political   philosophy   of   this   book   and   in   its   <br> </br>
   reinterpretation   of   natural   law   ,   and   I   have   to   thank   him   for   reading   the   proofs   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   am   also   most   grateful   to   Dr   Rupert   Cross   and   Mr   P.   F.   Strawson   ,   who   read   the   text   ,   for   their   beneficial   advice   and   criticism   .   WITHIN   a   few   years   of   its   <br> </br>
   publication   The   Concept   Of   Law   transformed   the   way   jurisprudence   was   understood   and   studied   in   the   English-speaking   world   and   beyond   .   Its   enormous   <br> </br>
   impact   led   to   a   multitude   of   publications   discussing   the   book   and   its   doctrines   ,   and   not   only   in   the   context   of   legal   theory   ,   but   in   political   and   moral   <br> </br>
   philosophy   too   .   For   many   years   Hart   had   it   in   mind   to   add   a   chapter   to   Tlze   Concept   if   Law   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   He   did   not   wish   to   tinker   with   the   text   whose   influence   has   been   so   great   ,   and   in   accordance   with   his   wishes   it   is   here   published   unchanged   ,   except   for   minor   <br> </br>
   corrections   .   But   he   wanted   to   respond   to   the   many   discussions   of   the   book   ,   defending   his   position   against   those   who   misconstrued   it   ,   refuting   unfounded   <br> </br>
   criticism   ,   and-of   equal   importance   in   his   eyes-conceding   the   force   of   justified   criticism   and   suggesting   ways   of   adjusting   the   books   doctrines   to   meet   <br> </br>
   those   points   .   That   the   new   chapter   ,   first   thought   of   as   a   preface   ,   but   finally   as   a   postscript   ,   was   unfinished   at   the   time   of   his   death   was   due   only   in   part   to   <br> </br>
   his   meticulous   perfectionism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   was   also   due   to   persisting   doubts   about   the   wisdom   of   the   project   ,   and   a   nagging   uncertainty   whether   he   could   do   justice   to   the   vigour   and   insight   of   the   <br> </br>
   theses   of   the   book   as   originally   conceived   .   Nevertheless   ,   and   with   many   interruptions   ,   he   persisted   with   work   on   the   postscript   and   at   the   time   of   his   <br> </br>
   death   the   first   of   the   two   intended   sections   was   nearly   complete   .   When   J   enifer   Hart   asked   us   to   look   at   the   drafts   and   decide   whether   there   was   anything   <br> </br>
   publishable   there   our   foremost   thought   was   not   to   let   anything   be   published   that   Hart   would   not   have   been   happy   with   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   were   ,   therefore   ,   delighted   to   discover   that   for   the   most   part   the   first   section   of   the   postscript   was   in   such   a   finished   state   .   We   found   only   <br> </br>
   hand-written   notes   intended   for   the   second   section   ,   and   they   were   too   fragmentary   and   inchoate   to   be   publishable   .   In   contrast   the   first   section   existed   <br> </br>
   in   several   versions   ,   having   been   typed   ,   revised   ,   retyped   ,   and   rerevised   .   Even   the   most   recent   version   was   obviously   not   thought   by   him   to   be   in   a   final   <br> </br>
   state   .   There   are   numerous   alterations   in   pencil   and   Biro   .   Moreover   ,   Hart   did   not   discard   earlier   versions   ,   but   seems   to   have   continued   to   work   on   <br> </br>
   whichever   version   was   to   hand   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   While   this   made   the   editorial   task   more   difficult   ,   the   changes   introduced   over   the   last   two   years   were   mostly   changes   of   stylistic   nuance   ,   which   itself   <br> </br>
   indicated   that   he   was   essentially   satisfied   with   the   text   as   it   was   .   Our   task   was   to   compare   the   alternative   versions   ,   and   where   they   did   not   match   <br> </br>
   establish   whether   segments   of   text   which   appeared   in   only   one   of   them   were   missing   from   the   others   because   he   discarded   them   ,   or   because   he   never   had   one   <br> </br>
   version   incorporating   all   the   emendations   .   The   published   text   includes   all   the   emendations   which   were   not   discarded   by   Hart   ,   and   which   appear   in   <br> </br>
   versions   of   the   text   that   he   continued   to   revise   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   At   times   the   text   itself   was   incoherent   .   Often   this   must   have   been   the   result   of   a   misreading   of   a   manuscript   by   the   typist   ,   whose   mistakes   Hart   did   not   <br> </br>
   always   notice   .   At   other   times   it   was   no   doubt   due   to   the   natural   way   in   which   sentences   get   mangled   in   the   course   of   composition   ,   to   be   sorted   out   at   the   final   <br> </br>
   drafting   ,   which   he   did   not   live   to   do   .   In   these   cases   we   tried   to   restore   the   original   text   ,   or   to   recapture   ,   with   minimum   intervention   ,   Harts   thought   .   One   <br> </br>
   special   problem   was   presented   by   Section   6   (   on   discretion   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   found   two   versions   of   its   opening   paragraph   ,   one   in   a   copy   which   ended   at   that   point   ,   and   another   in   a   copy   containing   the   rest   of   the   section   .   As   the   <br> </br>
   truncated   version   was   in   a   copy   incorporating   many   of   his   most   recent   revisions   ,   and   was   never   discarded   by   him   ,   and   as   it   is   consonant   with   his   general   <br> </br>
   discussion   in   the   postscript   ,   we   decided   to   allow   both   versions   to   be   published   ,   the   one   which   was   not   continued   appearing   in   an   endnote   .   Hart   never   had   the   <br> </br>
   notes   ,   mostly   references   ,   typed   .   He   had   a   hand-written   version   of   the   notes   ,   the   cues   for   which   were   most   easily   traced   in   the   earliest   typed   copy   of   the   <br> </br>
   main   text   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Later   he   occasionally   added   references   in   marginal   comments   ,   but   for   the   most   part   these   were   incomplete   ,   sometimes   indicating   no   more   than   the   need   to   <br> </br>
   trace   the   reference   .   Timothy   Endicott   has   checked   all   the   references   ,   traced   all   that   were   incomplete   ,   and   added   references   where   Hart   quoted   Dworkin   or   <br> </br>
   closely   paraphrased   him   without   indicating   a   source   .   Endicott   also   corrected   the   text   where   the   quotations   were   inaccurate   .   In   the   course   of   this   work   ,   <br> </br>
   which   involved   extensive   research   and   resourcefulness   ,   he   has   also   suggested   several   corrections   to   the   main   text   ,   in   line   with   the   editorial   <br> </br>
   guidelines   set   out   above   ,   which   we   gratefully   incorporated   .   <br> </br>

   attention   to   the   legal   theory   of   the   last   I   50   years   and   neglect   classical   and   medieval   speculation   about   the   nature   of   law   ,   we   shall   find   a   situation   not   <br> </br>
   paralleled   in   any   other   subject   systematically   studied   as   a   separate   academic   discipline   .   No   vast   literature   is   dedicated   to   answering   the   questions   <br> </br>
   What   is   chemistry   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   or   What   is   medicine   ?   ,   as   it   is   to   the   question   What   is   law   ?   A   few   lines   on   the   opening   page   of   an   elementary   textbook   is   all   that   the   student   of   these   sciences   is   <br> </br>
   asked   to   consider   and   the   answers   he   is   given   are   of   a   very   different   kind   from   those   tendered   to   the   student   oflaw   .   No   one   has   thought   it   illuminating   or   <br> </br>
   important   to   insist   that   medicine   is   what   doctors   do   about   illnesses   ,   or   a   prediction   of   what   doctors   will   do   ,   or   to   declare   that   what   is   ordinarily   <br> </br>
   recognized   as   a   characteristic   ,   central   part   of   chemistry   ,   say   the   study   of   acids   ,   is   not   really   part   of   chemistry   at   all   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   ,   in   the   case   of   law   ,   things   which   at   first   sight   look   as   strange   as   these   have   often   been   said   ,   and   not   only   said   but   urged   with   eloquence   and   passion   ,   as   if   <br> </br>
   they   were   revelations   of   truths   about   law   ,   long   obscured   by   gross   misrepresentations   of   its   essential   nature   .   What   officials   do   about   disputes   is   ...   the   <br> </br>
   law   itself   I   The   prophecies   of   what   the   courts   will   do   ...   are   what   I   mean   by   the   law   Statutes   are   sources   of   Law   ...   not   parts   of   the   Law   itself   3   Constitutional   <br> </br>
   law   is   positive   morality   merely   4   One   shall   not   steal   if   somebody   steals   he   shall   be   punished   .   ...   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   at   all   existent   ,   the   first   norm   is   contained   in   the   second   norm   which   is   the   only   genuine   norm   ....   Law   is   the   primary   norm   which   stipulates   the   sanction   .   <br> </br>
   These   are   only   a   few   of   many   assertions   and   denials   concerning   the   nature   of   law   which   at   first   sight   ,   at   least   ,   seem   strange   and   paradoxical   .   Some   of   them   <br> </br>
   seem   to   conflict   with   the   most   firmly   rooted   beliefs   and   to   be   easily   refutable   so   that   we   are   tempted   to   reply   ,   Surely   statutes   are   law   ,   at   least   one   kind   of   <br> </br>
   law   even   if   there   are   others   :   Surely   law   can   not   just   mean   what   officials   do   or   courts   will   do   ,   since   it   takes   a   law   to   make   an   official   or   a   court   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   these   seemingly   paradoxical   utterances   were   not   made   by   visionaries   or   philosophers   professionally   concerned   to   doubt   the   plainest   deliverances   <br> </br>
   of   common   sense   .   They   are   the   outcome   of   prolonged   reflection   on   law   made   by   men   who   were   primarily   lawyers   ,   concerned   professionally   either   to   teach   or   <br> </br>
   practise   law   ,   and   in   some   cases   to   administer   it   as   judges   .   Moreover   ,   what   they   said   about   law   actually   did   in   their   time   and   place   increase   our   <br> </br>
   understanding   of   it   .   For   ,   understood   in   their   context   ,   such   statements   are   both   illuminating   and   puzzling   :   they   are   more   like   great   exaggerations   of   <br> </br>
   some   truths   about   law   unduly   neglected   ,   than   cool   definitions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   throw   a   light   which   makes   us   see   much   in   law   that   lay   hidden   but   the   light   is   so   bright   that   it   blinds   us   to   the   remainder   and   so   leaves   us   still   without   a   <br> </br>
   clear   view   of   the   whole   .   To   this   unending   theoretical   debate   in   books   we   find   a   strange   contrast   in   the   ability   of   most   men   to   cite   ,   with   ease   and   confidence   ,   <br> </br>
   examples   of   law   if   they   are   asked   to   do   so   .   Few   Englishmen   are   unaware   that   there   is   a   law   forbidding   murder   ,   or   requiring   the   payment   of   income   tax   ,   or   <br> </br>
   specifying   what   must   be   done   to   make   a   valid   will   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Virtually   everyone   except   the   child   or   foreigner   coming   across   the   English   word   law   for   the   first   time   could   easily   multiply   such   examples   ,   and   most   <br> </br>
   people   could   do   more   .   They   could   describe   ,   at   least   in   outline   ,   how   to   find   out   whether   something   is   the   law   in   England   they   know   that   there   are   experts   to   <br> </br>
   consult   and   courts   with   a   final   authoritative   voice   on   all   such   questions   .   Much   more   than   this   is   quite   generally   known   .   Most   educated   people   have   the   idea   <br> </br>
   that   the   laws   in   England   form   some   sort   of   system   ,   and   that   in   France   or   the   United   States   or   Soviet   Russia   and   ,   indeed   ,   in   almost   every   part   of   the   world   which   <br> </br>
   is   thought   of   as   a   separate   country   there   are   legal   systems   which   are   broadly   similar   in   structure   in   spite   of   important   differences   .   <br> </br>

   If   all   this   is   common   knowledge   ,   how   is   it   that   the   question   What   is   law   ?   has   persisted   and   so   many   various   and   extraordinary   answers   have   been   given   to   it   ?   Is   <br> </br>
   it   because   ,   besides   the   clear   standard   cases   constituted   by   the   legal   systems   of   modern   states   ,   which   no   one   in   his   senses   doubts   are   legal   systems   ,   there   <br> </br>
   exist   also   doubtful   cases   ,   and   about   their   legal   quality   not   only   ordinary   educated   men   but   even   lawyers   hesitate   ?   Primitive   law   and   international   law   <br> </br>
   are   the   foremost   of   such   doubtful   cases   ,   and   it   is   notorious   that   many   find   that   there   are   reasons   ,   though   usually   not   conclusive   ones   ,   for   denying   the   <br> </br>
   propriety   of   the   now   conventional   use   of   the   word   law   in   these   cases   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   existence   of   these   questionable   or   challengeable   cases   has   indeed   given   rise   to   a   prolonged   and   somewhat   sterile   controversy   ,   but   surely   they   can   not   <br> </br>
   account   for   the   perplexities   about   the   general   nature   of   law   expressed   by   the   persistent   question   What   is   law   ?   That   these   can   not   be   the   root   of   the   <br> </br>
   difficulty   seems   plain   for   two   reasons   .   First   ,   it   is   quite   obvious   why   hesitation   is   felt   in   these   cases   .   International   law   lacks   a   legislature   ,   states   <br> </br>
   can   not   be   brought   before   international   courts   without   their   prior   consent   ,   and   there   is   no   centrally   organized   effective   system   of   sanctions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Certain   types   of   primitive   law   ,   including   those   out   of   which   some   contemporary   legal   systems   may   have   gradually   evolved   ,   similarly   lack   these   features   ,   <br> </br>
   and   it   is   perfectly   clear   to   everyone   that   it   is   their   deviation   in   these   respects   from   the   standard   case   which   makes   their   classification   appear   <br> </br>
   questionable   .   There   is   no   mystery   about   this   .   Secondly   ,   it   is   not   a   peculiarity   of   complex   terms   like   law   and   legal   system   that   we   are   forced   to   recognize   <br> </br>
   both   clear   standard   cases   and   challengeable   borderline   cases   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   now   a  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> familiar </span></span></span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"><span class="subject level1 subject1"> fact </span></span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> though </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> once </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> too </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> little </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> stressed </span></span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"><span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ) </span></span></span>  that   this   distinction   must   be   made   in   the   case   of   almost   every   general   term   which   we   use   in   <br> </br>
   classifying   features   of   human   life   and   of   the   world   in   which   we   live   .   Sometimes   the   difference   between   the   clear   ,   standard   case   or   paradigm   for   the   use   of   an   <br> </br>
   expression   and   the   questionable   cases   is   only   a   matter   of   degree   .   A   man   with   a   shining   smooth   pate   is   clearly   bald   another   with   a   luxuriant   mop   clearly   is   not   <br> </br>
   but   the   question   whether   a   third   man   ,   with   a   fringe   of   hair   here   and   there   ,   is   bald   might   be   indefinitely   disputed   ,   if   it   were   thought   worth   while   or   any   <br> </br>
   practical   issue   turned   on   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Sometimes   the   deviation   from   the   standard   case   is   not   a   mere   matter   of   degree   but   arises   when   the   standard   case   is   in   fact   a   complex   of   normally   concomitant   <br> </br>
   but   distinct   elements   ,   some   one   or   more   of   which   may   be   lacking   in   the   cases   open   to   challenge   .   Is   a   flying   boat   a   vessel   ?   Is   it   still   chess   if   the   game   is   played   <br> </br>
   without   a   queen   ?   Such   questions   may   be   instructive   because   they   force   us   to   reflect   on   ,   and   make   explicit   ,   our   conception   of   the   composition   of   the   <br> </br>
   standard   case   but   it   is   plain   that   what   may   be   called   the   borderline   aspect   of   things   is   too   common   to   account   for   the   long   debate   about   law   .
