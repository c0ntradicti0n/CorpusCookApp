   their   rights   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   So   strong   and   far-reaching   are   these   rights   that   they   raise   the   question   of   what   ,   if   anything   ,   the   state   and   its   officials   may   do   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> How   much   room   do </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Our   main   conclusions   about   the   state   are   that   a   minimal   state   ,   limited   to   the   narrow   functions   of   protection   against   force   ,   theft   ,   fraud   ,   enforcement   of </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> contracts   ,   and   so   on   ,   is   justified   ;   that   any   more   extensive   state   will   violate   persons   ’   rights   not   to   be   forced   to   do   certain   things   ,   and   is   unjustified   ; </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> and   that   the   minimal   state   is   inspiring   as   well   as   right </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Two   noteworthy   implications   are   that  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> state </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> may   not   use   its   coercive   apparatus   for   the   purpose   of   get-   ting   some   citizens   to   aid   others   ,   or   in   order   to </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> prohibit   activities   to   people   for   their   own   good   or   protection </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Despite   the   fact   that   it   is   only   coercive   routes   toward   these   goals   that   are   excluded   ,   while   voluntary   ones   remain   ,   many   persons   will   reject   our   <br> </br>
   conclusions   instantly   ,   knowing   they   do   n’t   want   to   be-   lieve   anything   so   apparently   callous   toward   the   needs   and   suffering   of   others   .   I   know   that   reaction   <br> </br>
   ;   it   was   mine   when   I   first   began   to   consider   such   views   .   With   reluctance   ,   I   found   myself   becoming   convinced   of   (   as   they   are   now   often   called   )   libertarian   <br> </br>
   views   ,   due   to   various   considerations   and   arguments   .   This   book   contains   little   evidence   of   my   earlier   reluctance   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Instead   ,   it   contains   many   of   the   considerations   and   arguments   ,   which   I   present   as   forcefully   as   I   can   .   Thereby   ,  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   run   the   risk   of   offending   doubly   :   for   the </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> position </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> IX </span>  X   Preface   expounded   ,   and   for   the   fact   that   I   produce   reasons   to   support   this   position   .   My   earlier   reluctance   is   not   present   in   this   volume   ,   <br> </br>
   because   it   has   disappeared   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Over   time   ,   I   have   grown   accustomed   to   the   views   and   their   consequences   ,   and   I   now   see   the   political   realm   through   them   .   (   Should   I   say   that   they   enable   me   to   <br> </br>
   see   through   the   po-   litical   realm   ?   )   Since   many   of   the   people   who   take   a   similar   posi-   tion   are   narrow   and   rigid   ,   and   filled   ,   paradoxically   ,   with   resent-   <br> </br>
   ment   at   other   freer   ways   of   being   ,   my   now   having   natural   responses   which   fit   the   theory   puts   me   in   some   bad   company   .   I   do   not   welcome   the   fact   that   most   people   I   <br> </br>
   know   and   respect   disagree   with   me   ,   having   outgrown   the   not   wholly   admirable   pleasure   of   irritating   or   dumbfounding   people   by   producing   strong   reasons   to   <br> </br>
   support   positions   they   dislike   or   even   detest   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   write   in   the   mode   of   much   contemporary   philosophical   work   in   epistemology   or   metaphysics   :   there   are   elaborate   arguments   ,   claims   rebutted   by   unlikely   <br> </br>
   counterexamples   ,   surprising   theses   ,   puzzles   ,   abstract   structural   conditions   ,   challenges   to   find   another   theory   which   fits   a   specified   range   of   cases   <br> </br>
   ,   startling   conclusions   ,   and   so   on   .   Though   this   makes   for   intellectual   interest   and   excite-   ment   (   I   hope   )   ,   some   may   feel   that   the   truth   about   ethics   and   <br> </br>
   polit-   ical   philosophy   is   too   serious   and   important   to   be   obtained   by   such   “   flashy   ”   tools   .   Nevertheless   ,   it   may   be   that   correctness   in   ethics   is   not   found   <br> </br>
   in   what   we   naturally   think   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   A   codification   of   the   received   view   or   an   explication   of   accepted   principles   need   not   use   elaborate   arguments   .   It   is   thought   to   be   an   objection   to   other   <br> </br>
   views   merely   to   point   out   that   they   conflict   with   the   view   which   readers   wish   anyway   to   accept   .   But   a   view   which   differs   from   the   readers   ’   can   not   argue   for   <br> </br>
   itself   merely   by   pointing   out   that   the   received   view   conflicts   with   it   !   Instead   ,   it   will   have   to   subject   the   received   view   to   the   greatest   intellectual   <br> </br>
   testing   and   strain   ,   via   counterarguments   ,   scrutiny   of   its   presup-   positions   ,   and   presentation   of   a   range   of   possible   situations   where   even   its   <br> </br>
   proponents   are   uncomfortable   with   its   consequences   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Even   the   reader   unconvinced   by   my   arguments   should   find   that   ,   in   the   process   of   maintaining   and   supporting   his   view   ,   he   has   clar-   ified   and   deepened   it   .   <br> </br>
   Moreover   ,   I   like   to   think   ,   intellectual   hon-   esty   demands   that   ,   occasionally   at   least   ,   we   go   out   of   our   way   to   confront   strong   arguments   opposed   to   our   <br> </br>
   views   .   How   else   are   we   Preface   xi   to   protect   ourselves   from   continuing   in   error   ?   It   seems   only   fair   to   remind   the   reader   that   intellectual   honesty   has   its   <br> </br>
   dangers   ;   argu-   ments   read   perhaps   at   first   in   curious   fascination   may   come   to   con-   vince   and   even   to   seem   natural   and   intuitive   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Only   the   refusal   to   listen   guarantees   one   against   being   ensnared   by   the   truth   .   The   contents   of   this   volume   are   its   particular   arguments   ;   still   ,   I   can   <br> </br>
   indicate   further   what   is   to   come   .   Since   I   begin   with   a   strong   formulation   of   individual   rights   ,   I   treat   seriously   the   anarchist   claim   that   in   the   course   of   <br> </br>
   maintaining   its   monopoly   on   the   use   of   force   and   protecting   everyone   within   a   territory   ,   the   state   must   violate   individuals   ’   rights   and   hence   is   <br> </br>
   intrinsically   immoral   .   Against   this   claim   ,   I   argue   that   a   state   would   arise   from   anarchy   (   as   represented   by   Locke   ’s   state   of   nature   )   even   though   no   one   in-   <br> </br>
   tended   this   or   tried   to   bring   it   about   ,   by   a   process   which   need   not   violate   anyone   ’s   rights   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Pursuing   this   central   argument  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> of </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Part   I </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> leads   through   a   diversity   of   issues </span>  ;  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> these </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> include   why   moral   views   involve   side   constraints   on   action   rather   than </span>  <br> </br>

   ;  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Part   II </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> contends   that   no   more   extensive   state   can   be   justified </span>  .   I   proceed   by   arguing   that   a   diver-   sity   of   reasons   which   purport   to   justify   a   more   extensive   <br> </br>
   state   ,   do   n’t   .   Against   the   claim   that   such   a   state   is   justified   in   order   to   achieve   or   produce   distributive   justice   among   its   citizens   ,   I   de-   velop   a   theory   <br> </br>
   of   justice   (   the   entitlement   theory   )   which   does   not   require   any   more   extensive   state   ,   and   use   the   apparatus   of   this   theory   to   dissect   and   criticize   other   <br> </br>
   theories   of   distributive   justice   which   do   envisage   a   more   extensive   state   ,   focusing   especially   on   the   recent   powerful   theory   ofJohn   Rawls   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Other   reasons   that   some   might   think   justify   a   more   extensive   state   are   criticized   ,   including   equality   ,   envy   ,   workers   ’   control   ,   and   Marxian   theories   of   <br> </br>
   exploita-   tion   .   (   Readers   who   find   Part   I   difficult   should   find   Part   II   easier   ,   Prefacexii   with   Chapter   8   easier   than   Chapter   7   .   )   Part   II   closes   with   a   hypo-   <br> </br>
   thetical   description   of   how   a   more   extensive   state   might   arise   ,   a   tale   designed   to   make   such   a   state   quite   unattractive   .   Even   if   the   minimal   state   is   the   <br> </br>
   uniquely   justifiable   one   ,   it   may   seem   pale   and   unexciting   ,   hardly   something   to   inspire   one   or   to   present   a   goal   worth   fighting   for   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   assess   this   ,   I   turn   to   that   preeminently   inspiring   tradition   of   social   thought   ,   utopian   theory   ,   and   argue   that   what   can   be   saved   from   this   tradition   is   <br> </br>
   precisely   the   structure   of   the   minimal   state   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> argument </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> involves   a   comparison   of   dif-   ferent   methods   of   shaping   a   society   ,   design   devices   and   filter </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   My   emphasis   upon   the   conclusions   which   diverge   from   what   most   readers   believe   may   mislead   one   into   thinking   this   book   is   some   sort   of   political   tract   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> It   is </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> not   ;   it   is   a   philosophical   explora-   tion   of   issues   ,   many   fascinating   in   their   own   right   ,   which   arise   and   interconnect   when   we   consider   individual   rights </span>  <br> </br>

   At   any   rate   ,   I   believe   that   there   also   is   a   place   and   a   function   in   our   ongoing   intellectual   life   for   a   less   complete   work   ,   containing   un-   finished   <br> </br>
   presentations   ,   conjectures   ,   open   questions   and   problems   ,   leads   ,   side   connections   ,   as   well   as   a   main   line   of   argument   .   There   is   room   for   words   on   subjects   <br> </br>

   believe   them   to   be   the   absolutely   final   word   on   their   subject   .   But   it   ’s   not   ,   surely   ,   that   each   philosopher   thinks   that   he   finally   ,   thank   God   ,   has   found   the   <br> </br>
   truth   and   built   an   impregnable   fortress   around   it   .   <br> </br>

   All   those   things   are   lying   out   there   ,   and   they   must   be   fit   in   .   You   push   and   shove   the   material   into   the   rigid   area   getting   it   into   the   boundary   on   one   side   ,   and   <br> </br>
   it   bulges   out   on   another   .   You   run   around   and   press   in   the   protruding   bulge   ,   producing   yet   another   in   another   place   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> So   you   push   and   shove   and   clip   off   corners </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> from   the   things   so   they   ’ll   fit   and   you   press   in   until   finally   almost   every-   thing   sits   unstably   more   or   less   in   there   ;   what   does   n’t   gets   heaved   far   away   so </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> that   it   wo   n’t   be   noticed </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   Of   course   ,   it   ’s   not   all   that   crude   .   There   ’s   also   the   coaxing   and   cajoling   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> And   the   body   En-   glish   .   ) </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Then   ,   back   to   the   darkroom   to   touch   up   the   rents   ,   rips   ,   and   tears   in   the   fabric   of   the   perimeter </span>  .   All   that   remains   is   to   publish   the   photograph   as   a   <br> </br>
   representation   of   exactly   how   things   are   ,   and   to   note   how   nothing   fits   properly   into   any   other   shape   .   No   philosopher   says   :   “   There   ’s   where   I   started   ,   here   <br> </br>
   ’s   where   I   ended   up   ;   the   major   weakness   in   my   work   is   that   I   went   from   there   to   here   ;   in   particular   ,   here   are   the   most   notable   distortions   ,   pushings   ,   shovings   <br> </br>
   ,   maulings   ,   gougings   ,   stretchings   ,   and   chip-   pings   that   I   committed   during   the   trip   ;   not   to   mention   the   things   thrown   away   and   ignored   ,   and   all   those   <br> </br>
   avertings   of   gaze   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ”   The   reticence   of   philosophers   about   the   weaknesses   they   per-   ceive   in   their   own   views   is   not   ,   I   think   ,   simply   a   question   of   philosophical   honesty   and   <br> </br>
   integrity   ,   though   it   is   that   or   at   least   becomes   that   when   brought   to   consciousness   .   The   reticence   is   con-   nected   with   philosophers   ’   purposes   in   <br> </br>
   formulating   views   .   Why   do   they   strive   to   force   everything   into   that   one   fixed   perimeter   ?   Why   not   another   perimeter   ,   or   ,   more   radically   ,   why   not   leave   <br> </br>
   things   where   they   are   ?   What   does   having   everything   within   a   perimeter   do   for   us   ?   Why   do   we   want   it   so   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   What   does   it   shield   us   from   ?   )   From   these   deep   (   and   frightening   )   questions   ,   I   hope   not   to   be   able   to   manage   to   avert   my   gaze   in   future   work   .   However   ,   my   reason   <br> </br>
   for   mentioning   these   issues   here   is   not   that   I   feel   they   pertain   more   strongly   to   this   work   than   to   other   philo-   sophical   writings   .   What   I   say   in   this   book   is   ,   <br> </br>
   I   think   ,   correct   .   This   is   not   my   way   of   taking   it   back   .   Rather   ,   I   propose   to   give   it   XIV   Preface   all   to   you   :   the   doubts   and   worries   and   uncertainties   as   well   as   <br> </br>
   the   beliefs   ,   convictions   ,   and   arguments   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   At   those   particular   points   in   my   arguments   ,   transitions   ,   as-   sumptions   ,   and   so   forth   ,   where   I   feel   the   strain   ,   I   try   to   comment   or   at   least   to   draw   the   reader   <br> </br>
   ’s   attention   to   what   makes   me   uneasy   .   In   advance   ,   it   is   possible   to   voice   some   general   theoretical   worries   .   This   book   does   not   present   a   precise   theory   of   <br> </br>
   the   moral   basis   of   individual   rights   ;   it   does   not   contain   a   precise   statement   and   jus-   tification   of   a   theory   of   retributive   punishment   ;   or   a   precise   <br> </br>
   state-   ment   of   the   principles   of   the   tripartite   theory   of   distributive   jus-   tice   it   presents   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Much   of   what   I   say   rests   upon   or   uses   general   features   that   I   believe   such   theories   would   have   were   they   worked   out   .   I   would   like   to   write   on   these   topics   in   the   <br> </br>
   future   .   If   I   do   ,   no   doubt   the   resulting   theory   will   differ   from   what   I   now   expect   it   to   be   ,   and   this   would   require   some   modifications   in   the   superstruc-   ture   <br> </br>
   erected   here   .   It   would   be   foolish   to   expect   that   I   shall   com-   plete   these   fundamental   tasks   satisfactorily   ;   as   it   would   be   to   remain   silent   until   they   are   <br> </br>
   done   .   Perhaps   this   essay   will   stimulate   others   to   help   .   <br> </br>

   JL.HE   first   nine   chapters   of   this   essay   were   written   during   19711972   ,   while   I   was   a   Fellow   at   the   Center   for   Advanced   Study   in   the   Behavioral   Sciences   at   <br> </br>
   Palo   Alto   ,   a   minimally   struc-   tured   academic   institution   bordering   on   individualist   anarchy   .   I   am   very   grateful   to   the   Center   and   its   staff   for   providing   <br> </br>
   an   environ-   ment   so   conducive   to   getting   things   done   .   Chapter   10   was   pre-   sented   in   a   symposium   on   “   Utopia   and   Utopianism   ”   at   a   meeting   of   the   Eastern   <br> </br>
   Division   of   the   American   Philosophical   Association   in   1969   ;   some   points   from   that   delivered   address   appear   scattered   in   the   other   chapters   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   whole   manuscript   was   rewritten   during   the   summer   of   1973   .   Barbara   Nozick   ’s   objections   to   some   of   the   positions   defended   here   helped   me   to   sharpen   my   <br> </br>
   views   ;   in   addition   she   helped   enor-   mously   in   innumerable   other   ways   .   Over   several   years   ,   I   have   bene-   fited   from   Michael   Walzer   ’s   comments   ,   questions   ,   <br> </br>
   and   counter-   arguments   as   I   tried   out   on   him   ideas   on   some   topics   of   this   essay   .   I   have   received   detailed   and   very   helpful   written   comments   on   the   whole   <br> </br>
   manuscript   written   at   the   Center   from   W.   V.   Quine   ,   Derek   Parfit   ,   and   Gilbert   Harman   ,   on   Chapter   7   from   John   Rawls   and   Frank   Michelman   ,   and   on   an   earlier   <br> </br>
   draft   of   Part   I   from   Alan   Dershowitz   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   also   have   benefited   from   a   discussion   with   Ronald   Dworkin   on   how   competing   protective   agencies   would(n’t   )   work   ,   and   from   suggestions   by   Burton   Dreben   .   <br> </br>
   Various   stages   of   various   portions   of   this   manuscript   were   read   and   dis-   cussed   ,   over   the   years   ,   at   meetings   of   the   Society   for   Ethical   and   Legal   <br> </br>
   Philosophy   (   SELF   )   ;   the   regular   discussions   with   its   members   have   been   a   source   of   intellectual   stimulation   and   pleasure   .   It   was   a   long   conversation   <br> </br>
   about   six   years   ago   with   Murray   Rothbard   that   stimulated   my   interest   in   individualist   anarchist   theory   .   Even   xv   XVI   Acknowledgments   longer   ago   ,   <br> </br>
   arguments   with   Bruce   Goldberg   led   me   to   take   liber-   tarian   views   seriously   enough   to   want   to   refute   them   ,   and   so   to   pursue   the   subject   further   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   result   is   before   the   reader   .   PART   I   State-of-Nature   Theory   ,   orHow   to   Back   into   a   State   without   Really   Trying   Why   State-of-Nature   Theory   ?   jL   F   the   state   <br> </br>
   did   not   exist   would   it   be   necessary   to   invent   it   ?   Would   one   be   needed   ,   and   would   it   have   to   be   invented   ?   These   questions   arise   for   political   philosophy   and   <br> </br>
   for   a   theory   explaining   political   phenomena   and   are   answered   by   investigating   the   “   state   of   nature   ,   ”   to   use   the   terminology   of   traditional   political   <br> </br>
   theory   .   The   justification   for   resuscitating   this   archaic   notion   would   have   to   be   the   fruitfulness   ,   interest   ,   and   far-reaching   implications   of   the   <br> </br>
   theory   that   results   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   For   the   (   less   trusting   )   readers   who   desire   some   assurance   in   advance   ,   this   chapter   discusses   reasons   why   it   is   im-   portant   to   pursue   state-of-nature   <br> </br>
   theory   ,   reasons   for   thinking   that   theory   would   be   a   fruitful   one   .   These   reasons   necessarily   are   some-   what   abstract   and   metatheoretical   .   The   best   reason   <br> </br>
   is   the   developed   theory   itself   .   4   State-of-Nature   Theory   The   fundamental   question   of   political   philosophy   ,   one   that   pre-   cedes   questions   about   how   the   <br> </br>
   state   should   be   organized   ,   is   whether   there   should   be   any   state   at   all   .   Why   not   have   anarchy   ?   Since   anarchist   theory   ,   if   tenable   ,   undercuts   the   whole   <br> </br>
   subject   of   political   philosophy   ,   it   is   appropriate   to   begin   political   philosophy   with   an   examination   of   its   major   theoretical   alternative   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Those   who   consider   anarchism   not   an   unattractive   doctrine   will   think   it   possible   that   political   philosophy   ends   here   as   well   .   Others   impa-   tiently   will   <br> </br>
   await   what   is   to   come   afterwards   .   Yet   ,   as   we   shall   see   ,   archists   and   anarchists   alike   ,   those   who   spring   gingerly   from   the   starting   point   as   well   as   those   <br> </br>
   reluctantly   argued   away   from   it   ,   can   agree   that   beginning   the   subject   of   political   philosophy   with   state-   of-nature   theory   has   an   explanatory   purpose   .   (   <br> </br>
   Such   a   purpose   is   ab-   sent   when   epistemology   is   begun   with   an   attempt   to   refute   the   skeptic   .   )   Which   anarchic   situation   should   we   investigate   to   answer   the   <br> </br>
   question   of   why   not   anarchy   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Perhaps   the   one   that   would   exist   if   the   actual   political   situation   did   n’t </span>  ,   while  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> no   other   possible   politi-   cal   one   did </span>  .   But   apart   from   the   gratuitous   <br> </br>
   assumption   that   every-   one   everywhere   would   be   in   the   same   nonstate   boat   and   the   enor-   mous   unmanageability   of   pursuing   that   counterfactual   to   arrive   at   a   <br> </br>
   particular   situation   ,   that   situation   would   lack   fundamental   theo-   retical   interest   .   To   be   sure   ,   if   that   nonstate   situation   were   suf-   ficiently   awful   ,   <br> </br>
   there   would   be   a   reason   to   refrain   from   disman-   tling   or   destroying   a   particular   state   and   replacing   it   with   none   ,   now   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   would   be   more   promising   to   focus   upon   a   fundamental   ab-   stract   description   that   would   encompass   all   situations   of   interest   ,   including   “   where   we   would   <br> </br>

   The   subjects   of   psychology   and   sociology   are   far   too   feeble   to   support   generalizing   so   pessimistically   across   all   societies   and   persons   ,   especially   <br> </br>
