   <br> </br>
   How   much   room   do   individual   rights   leave   for   the   state   ?   The   nature   of   the   central   concern   of   this   book   ;   a   wide   and   diverse   variety   of   topics   Our   main   <br> </br>
   conclusions   about   the   state   are   that   a   minimal   state   ,   fraud   ,   enforcement   of   contracts   ,   and   so   on   ,   is   justified   ;   that   any   do   certain   things   ,   and   is   <br> </br>
   unjustified   ;   and   that   the   minimal   state   is   Despite   the   fact   that   it   is   only   coercive   routes   toward   these   goals   lieve   anything   so   apparently   callous   toward   <br> </br>
   the   needs   and   suffering   of   others   .   I   know   that   reaction   ;   it   was   mine   when   I   first   began   to   consider   such   views   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   With   reluctance   ,   I   found   myself   becoming   convinced   of   (   as   they   are   now   often   called   )   libertarian   views   ,   due   evidence   of   my   earlier   reluctance   .   Instead   ,   <br> </br>
   it   contains   many   of   the   considerations   and   arguments   ,   which   I   present   as   forcefully   as   I   can   .   Thereby   ,   I   run   the   risk   of   offending   doubly   :   for   the   position   <br> </br>
   My   earlier   reluctance   is   not   present   in   this   volume   ,   because   it   has   disappeared   .   Over   time   ,   I   have   grown   accustomed   to   the   views   and   their   consequences   ,   <br> </br>
   and   I   now   see   the   political   realm   through   them   .   (   Should   I   say   that   they   enable   me   to   see   through   the   po-   litical   realm   ?   )   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Since   many   of   the   people   who   take   a   similar   posi-   tion   are   narrow   and   rigid   ,   and   filled   ,   paradoxically   ,   with   resent-   ment   at   other   freer   ways   of   being   ,   my   now   <br> </br>
   having   natural   responses   which   fit   the   theory   puts   me   in   some   bad   company   .   I   do   not   welcome   the   fact   that   most   people   I   know   and   respect   disagree   theory   which   <br> </br>
   fits   a   specified   range   of   cases   ,   startling   conclusions   ,   and   so   on   .   Though   this   makes   for   intellectual   interest   and   excite-   ment   (   I   hope   )   ,   some   may   feel   <br> </br>
   that   the   truth   about   ethics   and   polit-   A   codification   of   the   received   view   or   an   explication   of   accepted   principles   need   not   use   elaborate   arguments   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   thought   to   be   an   which   differs   from   the   readers   ’   can   not   argue   for   itself   merely   by   pointing   out   that   the   received   view   conflicts   with   it   !   Instead   ,   it   <br> </br>
   Even   the   reader   unconvinced   by   my   arguments   should   find   that   ,   in   the   process   of   maintaining   and   supporting   his   view   ,   he   has   clar-   ified   and   deepened   it   .   <br> </br>
   Moreover   ,   I   like   to   think   ,   intellectual   hon-   esty   demands   that   ,   occasionally   at   least   ,   we   go   out   of   our   way   to   Preface   xi   remind   the   reader   that   <br> </br>
   intellectual   honesty   has   its   dangers   ;   argu-   ments   read   perhaps   at   first   in   curious   fascination   may   come   to   con-   vince   and   even   to   seem   natural   and   <br> </br>
   intuitive   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Only   the   refusal   to   listen   guarantees   one   against   being   ensnared   by   the   truth   .   The   contents   of   this   volume   are   its   particular   arguments   ;   still   ,   I   can   <br> </br>
   indicate   further   what   is   to   come   .   Since   I   begin   with   a   strong   Against   this   claim   ,   I   argue   that   a   state   would   arise   from   anarchy   (   as   represented   by   Locke   ’s   <br> </br>
   state   of   nature   )   even   though   no   one   in-   tended   this   or   tried   to   bring   it   about   ,   by   a   process   which   need   not   involve   side   constraints   on   action   rather   than   <br> </br>
   merely   being   goal-   directed   ,   the   treatment   of   animals   ,   why   it   is   so   satisfying   to   ex-   plain   complicated   patterns   as   arising   by   processes   in   which   no   one   <br> </br>
   intends   them   ,   the   reasons   why   some   actions   are   prohibited   rather   fairness   ,   ”   preemptive   attack   ,   and   preventive   detention   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   These   issues   and   others   are   brought   to   bear   in   investigating   the   nature   and   moral   legitimacy   ,   of   the   state   and   of   anarchy   .   Part   I   justifies   the   minimal   <br> </br>
   state   ;   Part   II   contends   that   no   more   extensive   state   can   be   justified   .   I   proceed   by   arguing   that   a   diver-   do   n’t   .   Against   the   claim   that   such   a   state   is   <br> </br>
   justified   in   order   to   achieve   or   produce   distributive   justice   among   its   citizens   ,   I   de-   velop   a   theory   of   justice   (   the   entitlement   theory   )   which   does   not   <br> </br>
   which   do   envisage   a   more   extensive   state   ,   focusing   especially   on   the   recent   powerful   theory   ofJohn   Rawls   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Other   reasons   that   some   tion   .   (   Readers   who   find   Part   I   difficult   should   find   Part   II   easier   ,   Prefacexii   thetical   description   of   how   a   more   extensive   state   <br> </br>
   might   arise   ,   a   tale   designed   to   make   such   a   state   quite   unattractive   .   Even   if   the   minimal   state   is   the   uniquely   justifiable   one   ,   it   may   seem   pale   and   of   the   <br> </br>
   minimal   state   .   The   argument   involves   a   comparison   of   dif-   ferent   methods   of   shaping   a   society   ,   design   devices   and   filter   de-   vices   ,   and   the   presentation   <br> </br>
   of   a   model   which   invites   application   of   the   mathematical   economist   ’s   notion   of   the   core   of   an   economy   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   and   interconnect   when   we   consider   individual   rights   and   the   state   .   through   all   of   the   details   of   the   view   he   presents   ,   and   its   prob-   finished   ,   complete   ,   <br> </br>
   and   elegant   whole   .   This   is   not   my   view   .   At   any   rate   ,   I   believe   that   there   also   is   a   place   and   a   function   in   our   leads   ,   side   connections   ,   as   well   as   a   main   line   of   <br> </br>
   argument   .   There   Indeed   ,   the   usual   manner   of   presenting   philosophical   work   puz-   believe   them   to   be   the   absolutely   final   word   on   their   subject   .   But   God   ,   has   <br> </br>
   found   the   truth   and   built   an   impregnable   fortress   around   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   We   are   all   actually   much   more   modest   than   that   .   For   good   reason   .   Having   thought   long   and   hard   about   the   view   he   pro-   poses   ,   a   philosopher   has   a   reasonably   <br> </br>
   good   idea   about   its   weak   points   ;   the   places   where   great   intellectual   weight   is   placed   upon   something   perhaps   too   fragile   to   bear   it   ,   the   places   where   the   he   <br> </br>
   feels   uneasy   about   .   those   things   are   lying   out   there   ,   and   they   must   be   fit   in   .   You   push   and   shove   the   material   into   the   rigid   area   getting   it   into   the   in   <br> </br>
   another   place   .   So   you   push   and   shove   and   clip   off   corners   from   thing   sits   unstably   more   or   less   in   there   ;   what   does   n’t   gets   heaved   far   away   so   that   it   wo   n’t   be   <br> </br>
   noticed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   Of   course   ,   it   ’s   not   all   that   fit   and   take   a   snapshot   ;   at   a   fast   shutter   speed   before   something   else   bulges   out   too   noticeably   .   Then   ,   back   to   the   darkroom   to   <br> </br>
   touch   up   the   rents   ,   rips   ,   and   tears   in   the   fabric   of   the   perimeter   .   into   any   other   shape   .   thrown   away   and   ignored   ,   and   all   those   avertings   of   gaze   .   ”   The   <br> </br>
   reticence   of   philosophers   about   the   weaknesses   they   per-   becomes   that   when   brought   to   consciousness   .   The   reticence   is   con-   where   they   are   ?   What   does   <br> </br>
   having   everything   within   a   perimeter   do   for   us   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Why   do   we   want   it   so   ?   (   What   does   it   shield   us   from   ?   )   From   these   deep   (   and   frightening   )   questions   ,   I   hope   not   to   be   able   sophical   writings   .   What   I   say   in   this   <br> </br>
   book   is   ,   I   think   ,   correct   .   This   is   not   my   way   of   taking   it   back   .   Rather   ,   I   propose   to   give   it   all   to   you   :   the   doubts   and   worries   and   uncertainties   as   well   as   the   <br> </br>
   beliefs   ,   convictions   ,   and   arguments   .   or   at   least   to   draw   the   reader   ’s   attention   to   what   makes   me   uneasy   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   advance   ,   it   is   possible   to   voice   some   general   theoretical   worries   .   This   book   does   not   present   a   precise   theory   of   the   moral   basis   of   individual   rights   ;   <br> </br>
   it   does   not   contain   a   precise   statement   and   jus-   tification   of   a   theory   of   retributive   punishment   ;   or   a   precise   state-   out   .   I   would   like   to   write   on   these   <br> </br>
   topics   in   the   future   .   If   I   do   ,   no   be   ,   and   this   would   require   some   modifications   in   the   superstruc-   ture   erected   here   .   It   would   be   foolish   to   expect   that   I   <br> </br>
   shall   com-   plete   these   fundamental   tasks   satisfactorily   ;   as   it   would   be   to   others   to   help   .   <br> </br>

   Barbara   Nozick   ’s   objections   to   some   of   the   positions   defended   here   helped   me   to   sharpen   my   views   ;   in   addition   she   helped   enor-   mously   in   innumerable   other   <br> </br>
   ways   .   Over   several   years   ,   I   have   bene-   fited   from   Michael   Walzer   ’s   comments   ,   questions   ,   and   counter-   arguments   as   I   tried   out   on   him   ideas   on   some   topics   of   <br> </br>
   this   essay   .   I   have   received   detailed   and   very   helpful   written   comments   from   Alan   Dershowitz   .   I   also   have   benefited   from   a   discussion   cussed   ,   over   the   <br> </br>
   years   ,   at   meetings   of   the   Society   for   Ethical   and   Legal   Philosophy   (   SELF   )   ;   the   regular   discussions   with   its   members   have   been   a   source   of   intellectual   <br> </br>
   stimulation   and   pleasure   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   was   XVI   Acknowledgments   longer   ago   ,   arguments   with   Bruce   Goldberg   led   me   to   take   liber-   tarian   views   seriously   enough   to   want   to   refute   them   ,   and   so   to   <br> </br>
   State-of-Nature   Theory   ,   orHow   to   Back   into   a   State   Why   State-of-Nature   Theory   ?   jL   F   the   state   did   not   exist   would   it   be   necessary   to   invent   it   ?   Would   one   be   <br> </br>
   needed   ,   and   would   it   have   to   be   invented   ?   These   questions   arise   for   political   philosophy   and   for   a   theory   explaining   political   phenomena   and   are   answered   <br> </br>
   by   investigating   the   “   state   be   the   fruitfulness   ,   interest   ,   and   far-reaching   implications   of   the   assurance   in   advance   ,   this   chapter   discusses   reasons   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   These   reasons   necessarily   are   some-   what   abstract   and   metatheoretical   .

   <br> </br>
   Perhaps   the   one   that   would   exist   if   one   everywhere   would   be   in   the   same   nonstate   boat   and   the   enor-   ficiently   awful   ,   there   would   be   a   reason   to   refrain   from   <br> </br>
   disman-   It   would   be   more   promising   to   focus   upon   a   fundamental   ab-   including   “   where   we   would   now   be   if   .   ”   Were   this   description   awful   enough   ,   the   state   would   <br> </br>
   come   out   as   a   preferred   alternative   ,   viewed   as   affectionately   as   a   trip   to   the   dentist   .   Such   awful   de-   scriptions   rarely   convince   ,   and   not   merely   because   <br> </br>
   they   fail   to   cheer   .   The   subjects   of   psychology   and   sociology   are   far   too   feeble   course   ,   people   know   something   of   how   actual   states   have   operated   ,   and   they   <br> </br>
   differ   in   their   views   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Given   the   enormous   importance   of   the   choice   between   the   state   and   anarchy   ,   caution   might   suggest   timate   of   the   nonstate   situation   :   the   state   would   be   <br> </br>

   state   of   nature   would   win   .   Those   who   view   the   state   as   an   abomi-   seems   one   could   always   bring   back   the   state   if   that   came   to   seem   desirable   .   The   “   maximax   ”   <br> </br>
   criterion   ,   on   the   other   hand   ,   would   here   ,   nor   does   maximizing   expected   utility   on   the   basis   of   such   frail   probabilities   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   More   to   the   point   ,   especially   for   deciding   what   goals   one   should   which   people   generally   satisfy   moral   constraints   and   generally   act   not   assume   that   all   <br> </br>
   people   act   exactly   as   they   should   .   Yet   this   ably   could   hope   for   .   Hence   investigating   its   nature   and   defects   is   of   crucial   importance   to   deciding   whether   <br> </br>
   there   should   be   a   state   rather   than   anarchy   .   If   one   could   show   that   the   state   would   be   su-   realistically   can   be   hoped   for   ,   or   would   arise   by   a   process   <br> </br>
   involving   arose   ,   this   would   provide   a   rationale   for   the   state   ’s   existence   ;   it   This   investigation   will   raise   the   question   of   whether   all   the   ac-   nature   by   a   <br> </br>
   natural   and   inevitable   process   of   deterioration   rather   as   medical   6   State-of-Nature   Theory   morally   permissible   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Some   anarchists   have   claimed   not   merely   that   whatever   legitimacy   the   state   ’s   fundamental   coercive   power   has   .   sent   of   the   person   to   whom   it   is   applied   .   )   <br> </br>
   This   provides   a   primary   arena   of   state   activity   ,   perhaps   the   only   legitimate   arena   .   Further-   which   one   might   think   could   be   appropriately   handled   in   the   <br> </br>
   po-   litical   arena   .   The   possible   ways   of   understanding   the   political   realm   are   as   view   it   as   emerging   from   the   nonpolitical   but   irreducible   to   it   ,   a   <br> </br>
   standing   of   the   whole   political   realm   ,   1   it   stands   as   the   most   de-   sirable   theoretical   alternative   ,   to   be   abandoned   only   if   known   to   be   impossible   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Let   us   call   this   most   desirable   and   complete   kind   of   explanation   of   a   realm   a   fundamental   explanation   of   the   realm   .   how   and   why   a   political   one   later   would   <br> </br>
   arise   out   of   it   ,   or   with   a   tinct   features   .   Except   perhaps   for   this   last   mode   ,   the   illumination   with   the   distance   ,   real   or   apparent   ,   of   the   starting   point   <br> </br>
   from   its   political   result   .   The   more   fundamental   the   starting   point   (   the   more   it   picks   out   basic   ,   important   ,   and   inescapable   features   of   the   <br> </br>
   understanding   to   reach   the   state   from   an   arbitrary   and   otherwise   start   .   Whereas   discovering   that   political   features   and   relations   were   reducible   to   ,   or   <br> </br>
   identical   with   ,   ostensibly   very   different   non-   political   ones   would   be   an   exciting   result   .   <br> </br>

   not   increase   our   understanding   of   a   realm   to   be   told   as   a   potential   explanation   what   we   know   to   be   false   :   that   by   doing   a   certain   dance   ,   ghosts   or   witches   or   <br> </br>
   goblins   made   the   realm   that   way   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   plausible   to   think   that   an   explanation   of   a   realm   must   present   an   underlying   mechanism   yielding   the   realm   .   (   Or   do   something   else   equally   productive   <br> </br>

   qualification   of   the   claim   in   the   text   awaits   advances   in   the   theory   of   explanation   .   Yet   other   dif-   punch   and   illumination   ,   even   if   incorrect   .   We   learn   <br> </br>
   much   by   seeing   how   the   state   could   have   arisen   ,   even   if   it   did   n’t   arise   that   bit   of   the   real   world   that   diverges   from   the   state-of-nature   model   is   as   it   is   .   <br> </br>
