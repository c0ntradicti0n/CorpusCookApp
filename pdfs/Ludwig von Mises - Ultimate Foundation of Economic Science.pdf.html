 by   This   essay   proposes   to   stress   the   fact   that   there   is   in   the   universe   something   for   the   description   and   analysis   of   which   the   natural   sciences   can   not   <br> </br>
   contribute   anything   .   There   are   events   beyond   the   range   of   those   events   that   the   procedures   of   the   natural   sciences   are   fit   to   observe   and   to   describe   .   <br> </br>
   There   is   human   action   .   It   is   a   fact   that   up   to   now   nothing   has   been   done   to   bridge   over   the   gulf   that   yawns   between   the   natural   events   in   the   consumma-   vi   <br> </br>
   Preface   tion   of   which   science   is   unable   to   find   any   finality   and   the   conscious   acts   of   men   that   invariably   aim   at   definite   ends   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   neglect   ,   in   the   treatment   of   human   action   ,   reference   to   the   ends   aimed   at   by   the   actors   is   no   less   absurd   than   were   the   endeavors   to   resort   to   finality   in   <br> </br>
   the   interpretation   of   natural   phenomena   .   Preface   vii   the   sciences   of   human   action   ,   its   claims   are   to   be   rejected   as   unwarranted   fables   .   The   positivists   <br> </br>
   themselves   ,   from   the   point   of   view   of   their   own   philosophy   ,   could   not   help   but   approve   of   such   a   verdict   .   Table   of   Contents   1   .   The   Permanent   Substratum   of   <br> </br>

   1   Knowledge   starts   from   the   clear   distinction   between   A   and   non-   f.   We   know   that   there   were   ages   of   cosmic   history   in   which   there   did   not   exist   beings   of   the   <br> </br>
   kind   we   call   Homo   sapiens   ,   and   we   are   free   to   assume   that   there   will   be   again   ages   in   which   this   species   will   not   exist   .   But   it   is   vain   for   us   to   speculate   about   <br> </br>
   the   conditions   of   beings   that   are   ,   in   the   logical   and   praxeological   structure   of   their   minds   and   in   the   power   of   their   senses   ,   essentially   different   from   <br> </br>

   explicit   by   expounding   its   contents   .   As   among   these   elements   of   teleology   is   also   the   category   of   causality   ,   the   category   of   action   is   the   fundamental   <br> </br>
   category   of   epistemology   ,   the   starting   point   of   any   epistemological   analysis   .   The   very   category   or   concept   of   action   comprehends   the   concepts   of   means   <br> </br>

   conduct   can   influence   the   course   of   events   .   There   were   in   the   early   history   of   mankind   attempts   to   ascribe   11   The   critics   of   apriorism   refer   to   the   fact   that   <br> </br>

   that   the   human   mind   has   the   ability   to   develop   theories   which   ,   although   a   priori   ,   are   instrumental   in   the   endeavors   to   construct   any   a   posteriori   system   of   <br> </br>
   knowledge   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Although   logic   ,   mathematics   ,   and   praxeology   are   not   derived   from   experience   ,   they   are   not   arbitrarily   made   ,   but   imposed   upon   us   by   the   world   in   which   we   <br> </br>
   live   and   act   and   which   we   want   to   study.4   They   are   not   empty   ,   not   meaningless   ,   and   not   merely   verbal   .   They   are   for   manthe   most   general   laws   of   the   universe   ,   <br> </br>
   and   without   them   no   knowledge   would   be   accessible   to   man   .   The   a   priori   categories   are   the   endowment   that   enables   man   to   attain   all   that   is   specifically   <br> </br>
   human   and   distinguishes   him   from   all   other   beings   .   Their   analysis   is   analysis   of   the   human   condition   ,   the   role   man   plays   in   the   universe   .   <br> </br>

   They   are   the   force   that   enables   man   to   create   and   to   produce   all   that   is   called   human   civilization   .   2   .   A   Hypothesis   about   the   Origin   of   A   Priori   Categories   <br> </br>
   The   concepts   of   natural   selection   and   evolution   make   it   possible   to   develop   a   hypothesis   about   the   emergence   of   the   logical   structure   of   the   human   mind   and   <br> </br>
   the   a   priori   .   However   ,   reference   to   this   interpretation   of   the   origin   of   the   a   priori   categories   does   not   entitle   us   to   call   them   a   precipitate   of   <br> </br>
