  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> systems   of   what   they   called   philosophy   of   history </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   essay   proposes   to   stress   the   fact   that   there   is   in   the   universe   something   for   the   description   and   analysis   of   which   the   natural   sciences   can   not   <br> </br>
   contribute   anything   .   There   are   events   beyond   the   range   of   those   events   that   the   procedures   of   the   natural   sciences   are   fit   to   observe   and   to   describe   .   <br> </br>
   There   is   human   action   .   It   is   a   fact   that   up   to   now   nothing   has   been   done   to   bridge   over   the   gulf   that   yawns   between   the   natural   events   in   the   consumma-   vi   <br> </br>
   Preface   tion   of   which   science   is   unable   to   find   any   finality   and   the   conscious   acts   of   men   that   invariably   aim   at   definite   ends   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   neglect   ,   in   the   treatment   of   human   action   ,   reference   to   the   ends   aimed   at   by   the   actors   is   no   less   absurd   than   were   the   endeavors   to   resort   to   finality   in   <br> </br>
   the   interpretation   of   natural   phenomena   .   It   would   be   a   mistake   to   insinuate   that   all   the   errors   concerning   the   epistemological   interpretation   of   the   <br> </br>
   sciences   of   human   action   are   to   be   ascribed   to   the   unwarranted   adoption   of   the   epistemology   of   positivism   .   There   were   other   schools   of   thought   that   <br> </br>
   confused   the   philosophical   treatment   of   praxeology   and   history   even   more   seriously   than   positivism   ,   e.g.   ,   historicism   .   Yet   ,   the   following   analysis   <br> </br>
   deals   first   of   all   with   the   impact   of   positivism.1   In   order   to   avoid   misinterpretation   of   the   point   of   view   of   this   essay   ,   it   is   advisable   ,   even   necessary   ,   <br> </br>
   to   stress   the   fact   that   it   deals   with   knowledge   ,   science   ,   and   reasonable   belief   and   that   it   refers   to   metaphysical   doctrines   only   as   far   as   it   is   necessary   <br> </br>
   to   demonstrate   in   what   respects   they   differ   from   scientific   knowledge   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> It   unreservedly   endorses   Lockes   principle   of   not   entertaining   any   proposition   with   greater   assurance </span>  than  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> proofs </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> it   is   built   upon   will   warrant </span>  .   The   <br> </br>
   viciousness   of   positivism   is   not   to   be   seen   in   the   adoption   of   this   principle   ,   but   in   the   fact   that   it   does   not   acknowledge   any   other   ways   of   proving   a   <br> </br>
   proposition   than   those   practiced   by   the   experimental   natural   sciences   and   qualifies   as   metaphysicalwhich   ,   in   the   positivist   jargon   ,   is   synonymous   <br> </br>
   with   nonsensicalall   other   methods   of   rational   discourse   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   expose   the   fallaciousness   of   this   fundamental   thesis   of   positivism   and   to   depict   its   disastrous   consequences   is   the   only   theme   of   this   essay   .   Although   <br> </br>
   full   of   contempt   for   all   it   considers   as   metaphysics   ,   the   epistemology   of   positivism   is   itself   based   upon   a   definite   brand   of   metaphysics   .   It   is   beyond   the   <br> </br>
   pale   of   a   rational   inquiry   to   enter   into   an   analysis   of   any   variety   of   metaphysics   ,   to   try   to   appraise   its   value   or   its   tenability   and   to   affirm   or   to   reject   it   <br> </br>
   .   What   discursive   reasoning   can   achieve   is   merely   to   show   whether   or   not   the   metaphysical   doctrine   in   question   contradicts   what   has   been   established   as   <br> </br>
   scientifically   proved   truth   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   this   can   be   demonstrated   with   regard   to   positivisms   assertions   concerning   Preface   vii   the   sciences   of   human   action   ,   its   claims   are   to   be   rejected   as   <br> </br>
   unwarranted   fables   .   The   positivists   themselves   ,   from   the   point   of   view   of   their   own   philosophy   ,   could   not   help   but   approve   of   such   a   verdict   .   General   <br> </br>
   epistemology   can   be   studied   only   by   those   who   are   perfectly   familiar   with   all   branches   of   human   knowledge   .   The   special   epistemological   problems   of   the   <br> </br>
   different   fields   of   knowledge   are   accessible   only   to   those   who   have   a   perfect   acquaintance   with   the   respective   field   .   There   would   not   be   any   need   to   <br> </br>
   mention   this   point   if   it   were   not   for   the   shocking   ignorance   of   everything   concerning   the   sciences   of   human   action   that   characterizes   the   writings   of   <br> </br>
   almost   all   contemporary   philosophers.2   It   may   even   be   doubted   whether   it   is   possible   to   separate   the   analysis   of   epistemological   problems   from   the   <br> </br>
   treatment   of   the   substantive   issues   of   the   science   concerned   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   basic   contributions   to   the   modern   epistemology   of   the   natural   sciences   were   an   accomplishment   of   Galilei   ,   not   of   Bacon   ,   of   Newton   and   Lavoisier   ,   not   <br> </br>
   of   Kant   and   Comte   .   What   is   tenable   in   the   doctrines   of   logical   positivism   is   to   be   found   in   the   works   of   the   great   physicists   of   the   last   hundred   years   ,   not   in   <br> </br>
   the   Encyclopedia   of   Unified   Science   .   My   own   contributions   to   the   theory   of   knowledge   ,   however   modest   they   may   be   ,   are   in   my   economic   and   historical   <br> </br>
   writings   ,   especially   in   my   books   Human   Action   and   Theory   and   History   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> present   essay </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> is   merely   a   supplement   to   and   a   commentary   on   what </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> economics   itself </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> says   about   its   own   epistemology </span>  .   <br> </br>

   He   who   seriously   wants   to   grasp   the   purport   of   economic   theory   ought   to   familiarize   himself   first   with   what   economics   teaches   and   only   then   ,   having   again   <br> </br>

   must   be   left   to   metaphysical   speculation   to   deal   with   the   problems   whether   this   proposition   can   be   borne   out   from   the   point   of   view   of   a   superhuman   <br> </br>
   intelligence   and   furthermore   whether   it   is   possible   for   a   human   mind   to   think   of   change   without   implying   the   concept   of   a   substratum   that   ,   while   it   changes   <br> </br>

   One   must   not   confuse   knowledge   with   mysticism   .   The   mystic   may   say   that   shadow   and   sunlight   are   the   same   .   1   Knowledge   starts   from   the   clear   distinction   <br> </br>
   between   A   and   non-   f.   We   know   that   there   were   ages   of   cosmic   history   in   which   there   did   not   exist   beings   of   the   kind   we   call   Homo   sapiens   ,   and   we   are   free   to   <br> </br>
   assume   that   there   will   be   again   ages   in   which   this   species   will   not   exist   .   But   it   is   vain   for   us   to   speculate   about   the   conditions   of   beings   that   are   ,   in   the   <br> </br>

   Nietzsches   concept   of   a   superman   is   devoid   of   any   epistemological   meaning   .   2   .   On   Action   Epistemology   deals   with   the   mental   phenomena   of   human   life   ,   with   <br> </br>
   man   as   he   thinks   and   acts   .   The   main   deficiency   of   traditional   epistemological   attempts   is   to   be   seen   in   their   neglect   of   the   praxeological   aspects   .   The   <br> </br>
   epistemologists   dealt   with   thinking   as   if   it   were   a   separate   field   cut   off   from   other   manifestations   of   human   endeavor   .   They   dealt   with   the   problems   of   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   The   shortcomings   of   this   approach   became   manifest   in   the   teachings   of   natural   theology   as   distinguished   from   revealed   theology   .  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Natural   theology </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> saw </span>  <br> </br>

   However   ,   it   must   be   emphasized   that   what   prevented   people   from   paying   attention   to   the   praxeological   issues   was   not   theological   considerations   .   It   was   <br> </br>
   the   passionate   longing   for   the   realization   of   the   Utopian   chimera   of   the   land   of   Cockaigne   .   As   the   science   of   economics   ,   the   up-to-now   best   elaborated   <br> </br>
   part   of   praxeology   ,   exploded   the   fallacies   of   every   brand   of   utopianism   ,   it   was   outlawed   and   stigmatized   as   unscientific   .   The   most   characteristic   trait   <br> </br>
   of   modern   epistemology   is   its   entire   neglect   of   economics   ,   that   branch   of   knowledge   whose   development   and   practical   application   was   the   most   <br> </br>
   spectacular   event   of   modern   history   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   3   .   On   Economics   The   study   of   economics   has   been   again   and   again   led   astray   by   the   vain   idea   that   economics   must   proceed   according   to   the   pattern   of   other   <br> </br>
   sciences   .   The   mischief   done   by   such   misconstructions   can   not   be   avoided   by   admonishing   the   economist   to   stop   casting   longing   glances   upon   other   fields   of   <br> </br>
   knowledge   or   even   to   ignore   them   entirely   .   Ignorance   ,   whatever   subject   it   may   concern   ,   is   in   no   case   a   quality   that   could   be   useful   in   the   search   for   truth   .   <br> </br>
   What   is   needed   to   prevent   a   scholar   from   garbling   economic   studies   by   resorting   to   the   methods   of   mathematics   ,   physics   ,   biology   ,   history   or   <br> </br>
   jurisprudence   is   not   slighting   and   4   The   Ultimate   Foundation   of   Economic   Science   neglecting   these   sciences   ,   but   ,   on   the   contrary   ,   trying   to   comprehend   <br> </br>
   and   to   master   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   He   who   wants   to   achieve   anything   in   praxeology   must   be   conversant   with   mathematics   ,   physics   ,   biology   ,   history   ,   and   jurisprudence   ,   lest   he   confuse   the   <br> </br>
   tasks   and   the   methods   of   the   theory   of   human   action   with   the   tasks   and   the   methods   of   any   of   these   other   branches   of   knowledge   .   What   was   wrong   with   the   various   <br> </br>
   Historical   Schools   of   economics   was   first   of   all   that   their   adepts   were   merely   dilettantes   in   the   field   of   history   .   No   competent   mathematician   can   fail   to   <br> </br>
   see   through   the   fundamental   fallacies   of   all   varieties   of   what   is   called   mathematical   economics   and   especially   of   econometrics   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   No   biologist   was   ever   fooled   by   the   rather   amateurish   organicism   of   such   authors   as   Paul   de   Lilienfeld   .   When   I   once   expressed   this   opinion   in   a   lecture   ,   a   <br> </br>
   young   man   in   the   audience   objected   .   You   are   asking   too   much   of   an   economist   ,   he   observed   nobody   can   force   me   to   employ   my   time   in   studying   all   these   sciences   .   <br> </br>
   My   answer   was   :   Nobody   asks   or   forces   you   to   become   an   economist   .   4   .   The   Starting   Point   of   Praxeological   Thinking   The   a   priori   knowledge   of   praxeology   is   <br> </br>
   entirely   different   categorially   differentfrom   the   a   priori   knowledge   of   mathematics   or   ,   more   precisely   ,   from   mathematical   a   priori   knowledge   as   <br> </br>
   interpreted   by   logical   positivism   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   starting   point   of   all   praxeological   thinking   is   not   arbitrarily   chosen   axioms   ,   but   a   self-evident   proposition   ,   fully   ,   clearly   and   necessarily   <br> </br>
   present   in   every   human   mind   .   An   unbridgeable   gulf   separates   those   animals   in   whose   minds   this   cognition   is   present   from   those   in   whose   minds   it   is   not   fully   <br> </br>
   and   clearly   present   .   Only   to   the   former   is   the   appellation   man   accorded   .   The   characteristic   feature   of   man   is   precisely   that   he   consciously   acts   .   Man   is   <br> </br>
   Homo   agens   ,   the   acting   animal   .   Allapart   from   zoologythat   has   ever   been   scientifically   stated   to   distinguish   man   from   nonhuman   mammals   is   implied   in   the   <br> </br>
   proposition   :   man   acts   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   act   means   :   to   strive   after   ends   ,   Some   Preliminary   Observations   Concerning   Praxeology   5   that   is   ,   to   choose   a   goal   and   to   resort   to   means   in   order   to   attain   <br> </br>
   the   goal   sought   .   The   essence   of   logical   positivism   is   to   deny   the   cognitive   value   of   a   priori   knowledge   by   pointing   out   that   all   a   priori   propositions   are   <br> </br>
   merely   analytic   .   They   do   not   provide   new   information   ,   but   are   merely   verbal   or   tautological   ,   asserting   what   has   already   been   implied   in   the   definitions   <br> </br>
   and   premises   .   Only   experience   can   lead   to   synthetic   propositions   .   There   is   an   obvious   objection   against   this   doctrine   ,   viz   .   ,   that   this   proposition   that   <br> </br>
   there   are   no   synthetic   a   priori   propositions   is   in   itself   aas   the   present   writer   thinks   ,   falsesynthetic   a   priori   proposition   ,   for   it   can   manifestly   not   be   <br> </br>
   established   by   experience   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   whole   controversy   is   ,   however   ,   meaningless   when   applied   to   praxeology   .   It   refers   essentially   to   geometry   .   Its   present   state   ,   especially   its   <br> </br>
   treatment   by   logical   positivism   ,   has   been   deeply   influenced   by   the   shock   that   Western   philosophy   received   from   the   discovery   of   non-Euclidian   <br> </br>
   geometries   .   Before   Bolyai   and   Lobachevsky   ,   geometry   was   ,   in   the   eyes   of   the   philosophers   ,   the   paragon   of   perfect   science   it   was   assumed   that   it   provided   <br> </br>
   unshakable   certainty   forever   and   for   everybody   .   To   proceed   also   in   other   branches   of   knowledge   more   geometrico   was   the   great   ideal   of   truth-seekers   .   All   <br> </br>
   traditional   epistemological   concepts   began   to   totter   when   the   attempts   to   construct   non-Euclidian   geometries   succeeded   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Yet   praxeology   is   not   geometry   .   It   is   the   worst   of   all   superstitions   to   assume   that   the   epistemological   characteristics   of   one   branch   of   knowledge   must   <br> </br>
   necessarily   be   applicable   to   any   other   branch   .   In   dealing   with   the   epistemology   of   the   sciences   of   human   action   ,   one   must   not   take   ones   cue   from   geometry   ,   <br> </br>
   mechanics   ,   or   any   other   science   .   The   assumptions   of   Euclid   were   once   considered   as   selfevidently   true   .   Present-day   epistemology   looks   upon   them   as   <br> </br>
   freely   chosen   postulates   ,   the   starting   point   of   a   hypothetical   chain   of   reasoning   .   Whatever   this   may   mean   ,   it   has   no   reference   at   all   to   the   problems   of   <br> </br>
   praxeology   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   starting   point   of   praxeology   is   a   self-evident   truth   ,   the   6   The   Ultimate   Foundation   of   Economic   Science   cognition   of   action   ,   that   is   ,   the   cognition   of   <br> </br>
   the   fact   that   there   is   such   a   thing   as   consciously   aiming   at   ends   .   There   is   no   use   cavilling   about   these   words   by   referring   to   philosophical   problems   that   <br> </br>
   have   no   bearing   upon   our   problem   .   The   truth   of   this   cognition   is   as   self-evident   and   as   indispensable   for   the   human   mind   as   is   the   distinction   between   A   and   <br> </br>
   non-A.   5   .   The   Reality   of   the   External   World   From   the   praxeological   point   of   view   it   is   not   possible   to   question   the   real   existence   of   matter   ,   of   physical   <br> </br>
   objects   and   of   the   external   world   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Their   reality   is   revealed   by   the   fact   that   man   is   not   omnipotent   .   There   is   in   the   world   something   that   offers   resistance   to   the   realization   of   his   wishes   and   <br> </br>
   desires   .   Any   attempt   to   remove   by   a   mere   fiat   what   annoys   him   and   to   substitute   a   state   of   affairs   that   suits   him   better   for   a   state   of   affairs   that   suits   him   <br> </br>
   less   is   vain   .   If   he   wants   to   succeed   ,   he   must   proceed   according   to   methods   that   are   adjusted   to   the   structure   of   something   about   which   perception   provides   <br> </br>
   him   with   some   information   .   We   may   define   the   external   world   as   the   totality   of   all   those   things   and   events   that   determine   the   feasibility   or   unfeasibility   <br> </br>
   ,   the   success   of   failure   ,   of   human   action   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   much   discussed   question   whether   physical   objects   can   or   can   not   be   conceived   as   existing   independently   of   the   mind   is   vain   .   For   thousands   of   years   the   <br> </br>
   minds   of   physicians   did   not   perceive   germs   and   did   not   divine   their   existence   .   But   the   success   or   failure   of   their   endeavors   to   preserve   their   patients   <br> </br>
   health   and   lives   depended   on   the   way   germs   influenced   or   did   not   influence   the   functioning   of   the   patients   bodily   organs   .   The   germs   were   real   because   they   <br> </br>
   conditioned   the   outcome   of   events   either   by   interfering   or   by   not   interfering   ,   either   by   being   present   in   or   by   being   absent   from   the   field   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   6   .   Causality   and   Teleology   Action   is   a   category   that   the   natural   sciences   do   not   take   into   account   .   The   scientist   acts   in   embarking   upon   his   research   Some   <br> </br>
   Preliminary   Observations   Concerning   Praxeology   1   work   ,   but   in   the   orbit   of   natural   events   of   the   external   world   which   he   explores   there   is   no   such   thing   as   <br> </br>
   action   .   There   is   agitation   ,   there   is   stimulus   and   response   ,   and   ,   whatever   some   philosophers   may   object   ,   there   is   cause   and   effect   .   There   is   what   appears   <br> </br>
   to   be   an   inexorable   regularity   in   the   concatenation   and   sequence   of   phenomena   .   There   are   constant   relations   between   entities   that   enable   the   scientist   <br> </br>
   to   establish   the   process   called   measurement   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   there   is   nothing   that   would   suggest   aiming   at   ends   sought   there   is   no   ascertainable   purpose   .   The   natural   sciences   are   causality   research   the   sciences   <br> </br>
   of   human   action   are   teleological   .   In   establishing   this   distinction   between   the   two   fields   of   human   knowledge   ,   we   do   not   express   any   opinion   concerning   <br> </br>
   the   question   whether   the   course   of   all   cosmic   events   is   or   is   not   ultimately   determined   by   a   superhuman   beings   design   .
