   the   teacher-student   relationship   at   any   level   ,   inside   or   outside   the   school   ,   reveals   its   fundamentally   narrative   character   .   This   relationship   <br> </br>
   involves   a   nar  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> rating </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> Subject </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   the   teacher   )   and   patient   ,   listening   objects   (   the   students   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   contents   ,   whether   values   or   empirical   dimensions   of   reality   ,   tend   in   the   process   of   being   narrated   to   become   lifeless   and   petrified   .   Education   is   <br> </br>
   suffering   from   narration   sickness   .   The   teacher   talks   about   reality   as   if   it   were   motionless   ,   static   ,   compartmentalized   ,   and   predictable   .   Or   else   he   <br> </br>
   expounds   on   a   topic   completely   alien   to   the   existential   experience   of   the   students   .   His   task   is   to   fill   the   students   with   the   contents   of   his   narration   <br> </br>
   contents   which   are   detached   from   reality   ,   disconnected   from   the   totality   that   engendered   them   and   could   give   them   significance   .   Words   are   emptied   of   <br> </br>
   their   concreteness   and   become   a   hollow   ,   alien   ated   ,   and   alienating   verbosity   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   outstanding   characteristic   of   this   narrative   education   ,   then   ,   is   the   sonority   of   words   ,   not   their   transforming   power   .   Four   times   four   is   sixteen   the   <br> </br>
   capital   of   Para   is   Belem   .   The   student   records   ,   memorizes   ,   and   repeats   these   phrases   without   perceiving   what   four   times   four   really   means   ,   or   realizing   <br> </br>
   the   true   significance   of   capital   in   the   affirmation   the   capital   of   Para   is   Belem   ,   that   is   ,   what   Belem   means   for   Pard   and   what   Para   means   for   Brazil   .   <br> </br>

Worse   yet   ,   it   turns   them   into   containers   ,   <br> </br>
   into   receptacles   to   be   filled   by   the   teacher   .   The   more   completely   she   fills   the   receptacles   ,   the   better   a   teacher   she   is   .   The   more   meekly   the   receptacles   <br> </br>
   permit   themselves   to   be   filled   ,   the   better   students   they   are   .   Education   thus   becomes   an   act   of   depositing   ,   in   which   the   students   are   the   depositories   and   <br> </br>
   the   teacher   is   the   depositor   .   Instead   of   communicating   ,   the   teacher   issues   communiques   and   makes   deposits   which   the   students   patiently   receive   ,   <br> </br>
   memorize   ,   and   repeat   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   is   the   banking   concept   of   education   ,   in   which   the   scope   of   action   allowed   to   the   students   extends   only   as   far   as   receiving   ,   filing   ,   and   storing   the   <br> </br>
   deposits   .   They   do   ,   it   is   true   ,   have   the   opportunity   to   become   collectors   or   cataloguers   of   the   things   they   store   .   But   in   the   last   analysis   ,   it   is   the   people   <br> </br>
   themselves   who   are   filed   away   through   the   lack   of   creativity   ,   transformation   ,   and   knowledge   in   this   (   at   best   )   misguided   system   .   For   apart   from   inquiry   ,   <br> </br>
   apart   from   the   praxis   ,   individuals   can   not   be   truly   human   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Knowledge   emerges   only   through   invention   and   re-invention   ,   through   the   restless   ,   impatient   ,   continuing   ,   hopeful   inquiry   human   beings   pursue   in   the   <br> </br>
   world   ,   with   the   world   ,   and   with   each   other   .   In   the   banking   concept   of   education   ,   knowledge   is   a   gift   bestowed   by   those   who   consider   themselves   <br> </br>
   knowledgeable   upon   those   whom   they   consider   to   know   nothing   .   Projecting   an   absolute   ignorance   onto   others   ,   a   characteristic   of   the   ideology)of   <br> </br>
   oppression   ,   negates   education   and   knowledge   as   processes   of   inquiry   .   The   teacher   presents   himself   to   his   students   as   their   necessary   opposite   by   <br> </br>
   considering   their   ignorance   absolute   ,   he-   justifies   his   own   existence   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   students   ,   alienated   like   the   slave   in   the   Hegelian   dialectic   ,   accept   their   ignorance   as   justifying   the   teachers   existencebut   ,   unlike   the   slave   ,   <br> </br>
   they   never   discover   that   they   educate   the   teacher   .   The   raison   detre   of   libertarian   education   ,   on   the   other   hand   ,   lies   in   its   drive   towards   reconciliation   <br> </br>
   .   Education   must   begin   with   the   solution   of   the   teacher-student   contradiction   ,   by   reconciling   the   poles   of   the   contradiction   so   that   both   are   <br> </br>
   simultaneously   teachers   and   students   .   This   solution   is   not  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   nor   can   it   be   ) </span>  found   in   the   banking   concept   .   On   the   contrary   ,   banking   education   maintains   and   <br> </br>
   even   stimulates   the   contradiction   through   the   following   attitudes   and   practices   ,   which   mirrOr   oppressive   society   as   a   whole   :  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ( </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> a </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> )   the   teacher   teaches </span>  <br> </br>

   program   content   ,   and   the   students   (   who   were   not   consulted   )   adapt   to   it   (   i   )   the   teacher   confuses   the   authority   of   knowledge   with   his   or   her   own   professional   <br> </br>
   authority   ,   which   she   and   he   sets   in   oppo   sition   to   the   freedom   of   the   students   (   j   )   the   teacher   is   the   Subject   of   the   learning   process   ,   while   the   pupils   are   <br> </br>
   mere   objects   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   is   not   surprising   that   the   banking   concept   of   education   regards   men   as   adaptable   ,   manageable   beings   .   The   more   students   work   at   storing   the   deposits   <br> </br>
   entrusted   to   them   ,   the   less   they   develop   the   critical   consciousness   which   would   result   from   their   intervention   in   the   world   as   transformers   of   that   world   <br> </br>
   .   The   more   completely   they   accept   the   passive   role   imposed   on   them   ,   the   more   they   tend   simply   to   adapt   to   the   world   as   it   is   and   to   the   fragmented   view   of   <br> </br>
   reality   deposited   in   them   .   The   capability   of   banking   education   to   minimize   or   annul   the   students   creative   power   and   to   stimulate   their   credulity   serves   <br> </br>
   the   interests   of   the   oppressors   ,   who   care   neither   to   have   the   world   re   vealed   nor   to   see   it   transformed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   oppressors   use   their   humanitarianism   to   preserve   a   profitable   situation   .   Thus   they   react   almost   instinctively   against   any   experiment   in   education   <br> </br>
   which   stimulates   the   critical   faculties   and   is   not   content   with   a   partial   view   of   reality   but   always   seeks   out   the   ties   which   link   one   point   to   another   and   <br> </br>
   one   problem   to   another   .   Indeed   ,   the   interests   of   the   oppressors   lie   in   changing   the   consciousness   of   the   oppressed   ,   not   the   situation   which   oppresses   <br> </br>
   them   1   for   the   more   the   oppressed   can   be   led   to   adapt   to   that   situation   ,   the   more   easily   they   can   be   dominated   .   To   achieve   this   end   ,   the   oppressors   use   the   <br> </br>
   banking   concept   of   education   in   conjunction   with   a   paternalistic   social   action   apparatus   ,   within   which   the   oppressed   receive   the   euphemistic   title   of   <br> </br>
   welfare   recipients   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   are   treated   as   individual   cases   ,   as   marginal   persons   who   deviate   from   the   general   configuration   of   a   good   ,   organized   ,   and   just   society   .   The   <br> </br>
   oppressed   are   regarded   as   the   pathology   of   the   healthy   society   ,   which   must   therefore   adjust   these   incompetent   and   lazy   folk   to   its   own   patterns   by   <br> </br>
   changing   their   mentality   .   These   marginals   need   to   be   integrated   ,   incorporated   into   the   healthy   society   that   they   have   forsaken   .   The   truth   is   ,   however   ,   <br> </br>
   that   the   oppressed   are   not   marginals   ,   are   not   people   living   outside   society   .   They   have   always   been   insideinside   the   structure   which   made   them   beings   for   <br> </br>
   others   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   solution   is   not   to   integrate   them   into   the   structure   of   oppression   ,   but   to   transform   that   structure   so   that   they   can   become   beings   for   themselves   .   Such   <br> </br>
   transformation   ,   of   course   ,   would   undermine   the   oppressors   purposes   hence   their   utilization   of   the   banking   concept   of   education   to   avoid   the   threat   of   <br> </br>
   student   cpnscientizagdo   .   The   banking   approach   to   adult   education   ,   for   example   ,   will   never   propose   to   students   that   they   critically   consider   reality   .   <br> </br>
   It   will   deal   instead   with   such   vital   questions   as   whether   Roger   gave   green   grass   to   the   goat   ,   and   insist   upon   the   importance   of   learning   that   ,   on   the   <br> </br>
   contrary   ,   floger   gave   green   grass   to   the   rabbit   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   humanism   of   the   banking   approach   masks   the   effort   to   turn   women   and   men   into   automatonsthe   very   negation   of   their   ontological   vocation   to   be   more   fully   <br> </br>
   human   .   Those   who   use   the   banking   approach   ,   knowingly   or   unknowingly   (   for  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> there   are   innumerable   well-intentioned   bank-clerk   teachers   who   do   not   realize </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> that   they   are   serving </span>  only   to   dehumanize   )   ,   fail   to   perceive   that   the   deposits   themselves   contain   contradictions   about   reality   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   ,   sooner   or   later   ,   these   contradictions   may   lead   formerly   passive   students   to   turn   against   their   domestication   and   the   attempt   to   domesticate   <br> </br>
   reality   .   They   may   discover   through   existential   experi   ence   that   their   present   way   of   life   is   irreconcilable   with   their   voca   tion   to   become   fully   human   .   <br> </br>
   They   may   perceive   through   their   relations   with   reality   that   reality   is   really   a   process   ,   undergoing   constant   transformation   .   If   men   and   women   are   <br> </br>
   searchers   and   their   ontological   vocation   is   humanization   ,   sooner   or   later   they   may   per   ceive   the   contradiction   in   which   banking   education   seeks   to   main   <br> </br>
   tain   them   ,   and   then   engage   themselves   in   the   struggle   for   their   liberation   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   humanist   ,   revolutionary   educator   can   not   wait   for   this   pos   sibility   to   materialize   .   From   the   outset   ,   her   efforts   must   coincide   with   those   of   the   <br> </br>
   students   to   engage   in   critical   thinking   and   the   quest   for   mutual   humanization   .   His   efforts   must   be   imbued   with   a   profqund   trust   in   people   and   their   <br> </br>
   creative   power   .   To   achieve   this   ,   they   must   be   partners   of   the   students   in   their   relations   with   them   .   The   banking   concept   does   not   admit   to   such   <br> </br>
   partnershipand   necessarily   so   .   To   resolve   the   teacher-student   contradiction   ,   to   ex   change   the   role   of   depositor   ,   prescriber   ,   domesticator   ,   for   the   <br> </br>
   role   of   student   among   students   would   be   to   undermine   the   power   of   oppression   and   serve   the   cause   of   liberation   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Implicit   in   the   banking   concept   is   Uie   assumption   of   a   dichotomy   between   human   beings   and   the   world   :   a   person   is   merely   in   the   world   ,   not   with   the   world   or   <br> </br>
   with   others   the   individual   is   spectator   ,   not   re-creator   .   In   this   view   ,   the   person   is   not   a  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> conscious </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> being </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   corpo   consciente   ) </span>  <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   he   or   she   is   rather   the   possessor   of   a   conscious   ness   :   an   empty   mind   passively   open   to   the   reception   of   deposits   of   reality   from   the   world   outside   .   For   <br> </br>
   example   ,   my   desk   ,   my   books   ,   my   coffee   cup   ,   all   the   objects   before   meas   bits   of   the   world   which   surround   mewould   be   inside   me   ,   exactly   as   I   am   inside   my   study   <br> </br>
   right   now   .   This   view   makes   no   distinction   between   being   accessible   to   consciousness   and   entering   consciousness   .   The   distinction   ,   however   ,   is   <br> </br>
   essential   :   the   objects   which   surround   me   are   simply   accessible   to   my   consciousness   ,   not   located   within   it   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   am   aware   of   them   ,   but   they   are   not   inside   me   .   It   follows   logically   from   the   banking   notion   of   consciousness   that   the   educator   s   role   is   to   regulate   the   way   <br> </br>
   the   world   enters   into   the   students   .   The   teachers   task   is   to   organise   a   process   which   already   occurs   spontaneously   ,   to   fill   the   students   by   making   deposits   <br> </br>
   of   information   which   he   or   she   considers   to   constitute   true   knowledge.2   And   since   people   receive   the   world   as   passive   entities   ,   education   should   make   <br> </br>
   them   more   passive   still   ,   and   adapt   them   to   the   world   .   The   educated   individual   is   the   adapted   person   ,   because   she   or   he   is   better   fit   for   the   world   .   <br> </br>
   Translated   into   practice   ,   this   concept   is   well   suited   to   the   purposes   of   the   oppressors   ,   whose   tranquility   rests   on   how   well   people   fit   the   world   the   <br> </br>
   oppressors   have   created   ,   and   how   little   they   question   it   .   The   more   completely   the   majority   adapt   to   the   purposes   which   the   dominant   minority   prescribe   <br> </br>
   for   them   (   thereby   depriving   them   of   the   right   to   their   own   purposes   )   ,   the   more   easily   the   minority   can   continue   to   prescribe   .   The   theory   and   practice   of   <br> </br>
   banking   education   serve   this   end   quite   efficiently   .   Verbalistic   lessons   ,   reading   requirements,3   the   methods   for   evaluating   knowledge   ,   the   distance   <br> </br>
   between   the   teacher   and   the   taught   ,   the   criteria   ,   for   promotion   :   everything   in   this   ready-to-wear   approach   serves   to   obviate   thinking   .   <br> </br>

   communication   .   Yet   only   through   communication   can   human   life   hold   meaning   .   The   teachers   thinking   is   authenticated   only   by   the   authenticity   of   the   <br> </br>
   students   thinking   .   The   teacher   can   not   think   for   her   students   ,   nor   can   she   impose   her   thought   on   them   .   Authentic   thinking   ,   think   ing   that   is   concerned   <br> </br>

   If   it   is   true   that   thought   has   meaning   only   when   generated   by   action   upon   the   world   ,   the   subordination   of   students   to   teachers   becomes   impossible   .   Because   <br> </br>
   banking   education   begins   with   a   false   understanding   of   men   and   women   as   objects   ,   it   can   not   promote   the   development   of   what   Fromm   calls   biophily   ,   but   <br> </br>
   instead   produces   its   opposite   :   necrophily   .   While   life   is   characterized   by   growth   in   a   structured   ,   functional   manner   ,   the   necrophilous   person   loves   all   <br> </br>
   that   does   not   grow   ,   all   that   is   mechanical   .   The   necrophilous   person   is   driven   by   the   desire   to   transform   the   organic   into   the   inorganic   ,   to   approach   life   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   .   .   Mem   ory   ,   rather   than   experience   having   ,   rather   than   being   ,   is   what   counts   .   The   necrophilous   person   can   relate   to   an   objecta   flower   or   a   persononly   if   he   <br> </br>
   possesses   it   hence   a   threat   to   his   possession   is   a   threat   to   himself   if   he   loses   possession   he   loses   contact   with   the   world   .   .   .   .   He   loves   control   ,   and   in   the   <br> </br>

   education   ,   which   serves   the   interests   of   oppression   ,   is   also   necrophilic   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Based   on   a   mechanistic   ,   static   ,   naturalistic   ,   spatialized   view   of   conscious   ness   ,   it   transforms   students   into   receiving   objects   .   It   attempts   to   <br> </br>
   control   thinking   and   action   ,   leads   women   and   men   to   adjust   to   the   world   ,   and   inhibits   their   creative   power   .   When   their   efforts   to   act   responsibly   are   <br> </br>
   frustrated   ,   when   they   find   themselves   unable   to   use   their   faculties   ,   people   suffer   .   This   suffering   due   to   impotence   is   rooted   in   the   very   fact   that   the   <br> </br>
   human   equilibrium   has   been   disturbed5   But   the   inability   to   act   which   causes   peoples   anguish   also   causes   them   to   reject   their   impotence   ,   by   attempting   .   .   <br> </br>

   may   a   revolutionary   society   inherit   these   methods   from   an   oppressor   society   .   The   revolutionary   society   which   practices   banking   education   is   either   <br> </br>
