   Through   dialogue   ,   the   teacher-of-the-students   and   the   students-of-the-teacher   cease   to   exist   and   a   new   term   emerges   :   teacherstudent   with   <br> </br>
   students-teachers   .   The   te&her   is   no   longer   merely   the-one-who-teaches   ,   but   one   who   is   himself   taught   in   dialogue   with   the   students   ,   who   in   turn   while   <br> </br>
   being   taught   also   teach   .   They   become   jointly   responsible   for   a   process   in   which   all   grow   .   In   this   process   ,   arguments   based   on   authority   are   no   longer   valid   <br> </br>
   ;   in   order   to   function   ,   authority   must   be   on   the   side   of   freedom   ,   not   against   it   .   Here   ,   no   one   teaches   another   ,   nor   is   anyone   self-taught   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   People   teach   each   other   ,   mediated   by   the   world   ,   by   the   cognizable   objects   which   in   banking   education   are   owned   by   the   teacher   .   The   banking   concept   (   with   <br> </br>
   its   tendency   to   dichotomize   everything   )   distinguishes   two   stages   in   the   action   of   the   educator   .   During   the   first   ,   he   cognizes   a   cognizable   object   while   <br> </br>
   he   prepares   his   lessons   in   his   study   or   his   laboratory   ;   during   the   second   ,   he   expounds   to   his   students   about   that   object   .   The   students   are   not   called   upon   to   <br> </br>
   know   ,   but   to   memorize   the   contents   narrated   by   the   teacher   .   Nor   do   the   students   practice   any   act   of   cognition   ,   since   the   object   towards   which   that   act   <br> </br>
   should   be   directed   is   the   property   of   the   teacher   rather   than   a   medium   evoking   the   critical   reflection   of   both   teacher   and   students   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Hence   in   the   name   of   the   preservation   of   culture   and   knowledge   we   have   a   system   which   achieves   neither   true   knowledge   nor   true   culture   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> The   problem-posing </span>  <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> reflection   by   himself   and   the   students   .   In   this   way   ,   the   problem-posing   educator   constantly   re-forms   his   reflections   in   the   reflection   of   the   The </span>  <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   7   can   not   exist   without   a   non-I.   In   turn   ,   the   not-I   depends   on   that   existence   .   The   world   which   brings   consciousness   into   existence   becomes   the   world   of   that   <br> </br>
   consciousness   .   Hence   ,   the   previously   cited   affirmation   of   Sartre   :   La   conscience   et   le   monde   sont   donnes   dun   meme   coup   .   In   perception   properly   so-called   <br> </br>
   ,   as   an   explicit   awareness   [   Gewahren   ]   ,   I   am   turned   towards   the   object   ,   to   &   e   paper   ,   for   instance   .   I   apprehend   it   as   being   this   here   and   now   ;   The   apprehension   <br> </br>
   is   a   singling   out   ,   every   object   having   a   background   in   experience   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Around   and   about   the   paper   lie   books   ,   pencils   ,   inkwell   ,   and   so   forth   ,   and   these   in   a   certain   sense   are   also   perceived   ,   perceptually   there   ,   in   the   field   of   <br> </br>
   intuition   ;   but   whilst   I   was   turned   towards   the   paper   there   was   no   turning   in   their   direction   ,   nor   any   apprehending   of   them   ,   not   even   in   a   secondary   sense   .   <br> </br>
   They   appeared   and   yet   were   not   singled   out   ,   were   not   posited   on   their   own   account   .   Every   perception   of   a   thing   has   such   a   zone   of   background   intuitions   or   <br> </br>
   background   awareness   ,   if   intuiting   already   includes   the   state   of   being   turned   towards   ,   and   this   also   is   a   conscious   experience   ,   or   more   briefly   a   <br> </br>
   consciousness   of   all   indeed   that   in   point   of   fact   lies   in   the   co-perceived   objective   background.10   That   which   had   existed   objectively   but   had   not   been   <br> </br>
   perceived   in   its   deeper   implications   (   if   indeed   it   was   perceived   at   all   )   begins   to   stand   out   ,   assuming   the   character   of   a   problem   and   therefore   of   <br> </br>
   challenge   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   ,   men   and   women   begin   to   single   out   elements   from   their   background   awareness   and   to   reflect   upon   them   .   These   ele   ments   are   now   objects   of   their   <br> </br>
   consideration   ,   and   ,   as   such   ,   objects   of   their   action   and   cognition   .   Education   is   thus   constantly   remade   in   the   praxis   .   In   order   to   be   ,   it   must   become   .   Its   <br> </br>
   duration   (   in   the   Bergsonian   meaning   of   the   word   )   is   found   in   the   interplay   of   the   opposites   permanence   and   change   .
