   Projecting   an   absolute   ignorance   onto   others   ,   a   characteristic   of   the   ideology)of   oppression   ,   negates   education   and   knowledge   as   processes   of   inquiry   <br> </br>

   Education   must   begin   with   the   solution   of   the   teacher-student   contradiction   ,   by   reconciling   the   poles   of   the   contradiction   so   that   both   are   <br> </br>

   The   more   students   work   at   storing   the   deposits   entrusted   to   them   ,   the   less   they   develop   the   critical   consciousness   which   would   result   from   their   <br> </br>

   adapt   to   the   world   as   it   is   and   to   the   fragmented   view   of   reality   deposited   in   them   .   The   capability   of   banking   education   to   minimize   or   annul   the   students   <br> </br>
   creative   power   and   to   stimulate   their   credulity   serves   the   interests   of   the   oppressors   ,   who   care   neither   to   have   the   world   re   vealed   nor   to   see   it   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> human </span>  .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Those   who   use   the   banking   approach   ,   knowingly   or   unknowingly </span>  (   for   there   are   innumerable   well-intentioned   bank-clerk   teachers   who   do   not   realize   <br> </br>
   that   they   are   serving   only   to   dehumanize   )   ,   fail   to   perceive   that   the   deposits   themselves   contain   contradictions   about   reality   .   But   ,   sooner   or   later   ,   <br> </br>
   these   contradictions   may   lead   formerly   passive   students   to   turn   against   their   domestication   and   the   attempt   to   domesticate   reality   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   They   may   discover   through   existential   experi   ence   that   their   present   way   of   life   is   irreconcilable   with   their   voca   tion   to   become   fully   human   .   They   may   <br> </br>
   perceive   through   their   relations   with   reality   that   reality   is   really   a   process   ,   undergoing   constant   transformation   .   If   men   and   women   are   searchers   and   <br> </br>
   their   ontological   vocation   is   humanization   ,   sooner   or   later   they   may   per   ceive   the   contradiction   in   which   banking   education   seeks   to   main   tain   them   ,   and   <br> </br>
   then   engage   themselves   in   the   struggle   for   their   liberation   .   But   the   humanist   ,   revolutionary   educator   can   not   wait   for   this   pos   sibility   to   materialize   .   <br> </br>
   From   the   outset   ,   her   efforts   must   coincide   with   those   of   the   students   to   engage   in   critical   thinking   and   the   quest   for   mutual   humanization   .   His   efforts   <br> </br>
   must   be   imbued   with   a   profqund   trust   in   people   and   their   creative   power   .   To   achieve   this   ,   they   must   be   partners   of   the   students   in   their   relations   with   them   .   <br> </br>
   The   banking   concept   does   not   admit   to   such   partnershipand   necessarily   so   .   To   resolve   the   teacher-student   contradiction   ,   to   ex   change   the   role   of   <br> </br>
   depositor   ,   prescriber   ,   domesticator   ,   for   the   role   of   student   among   students   would   be   to   undermine   the   power   of   oppression   and   serve   the   cause   of   <br> </br>

  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> Implicit   in   the   banking   concept   is   Uie   assumption   of   a   dichotomy   between   human   beings   and   the   world   :   a   person   is   merely   in   the   world   ,   not   with   the   world   or </span>  <br> </br>

   essential   :   the   objects   which   surround   me   are   simply   accessible   to   my   consciousness   ,   not   located   within   it   .   I   am   aware   of   them   ,   but   they   are   not   inside   me   .   It   <br> </br>
   follows   logically   from   the   banking   notion   of   consciousness   that   the   educator   s   role   is   to   regulate   the   way   the   world   enters   into   the   students   .   <br> </br>
