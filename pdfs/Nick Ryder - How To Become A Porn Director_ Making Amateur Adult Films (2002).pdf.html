   film   making   is   the   disdain   of   professionals   ,   a   money   maker   for   big   time   distributors   and   one   of   the   most   time   consuming   ,   frustrating   ,   cash   consuming   ,   <br> </br>
   trial   and   error   producing   industries   that   a   person   can   get   into   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   think   of   amateur   adult   films   in   the   same   light   as   the   comparison   between   Playboy   and   Gallery   men   ’s   magazines   .   If   you   have   never   heard   of   Playboy   magazine   <br> </br>
   stop   right   here   you   picked   up   the   wrong   book   .   Gallery   magazine   ,   on   the   other   hand   ,   is   a   little   less   known   but   goes   to   the   heart   of   the   difference   between   <br> </br>
   amateur   and   professional   porn   films   .   Gallery   magazine   runs   a   section   called   “   The   Girl   Next   Door   ”   .   This   feature   allows   husbands   ,   boyfriends   and   lesbian   <br> </br>
   lovers   to   send   pictures   of   their   naked   female   companions   into   the   magazine   to   be   printed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   These   pictures   are   not   retouched   and   capture   both   the   beautiful   and   the   ugly   in   its   rawest   form   .   It   ’s   reality   without   the   digital   re-mastering   that   makes   <br> </br>
   every   Playboy   centerfold   look   the   same   with   a   different   hair   color   .   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   7   Amateur   adult   films   are   much   <br> </br>
   the   same   .   Working   on   a   low   or   non-existent   budget   ,   directors   are   forced   to   film   raw   footage   of   sex   without   the   expensive   film   crews   the   high   priced   dubbing   <br> </br>
   studios   and   the   slick   marketing   packages   .   In   essence   it   ’s   sex   at   its   most   basic   level   :   between   real   humans   without   the   glitz   and   artificial   sweeteners   of   <br> </br>
   the   professional   films   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   It   ’s   the   “   adult   film   next   door   ”   approach   that   makes   it   real   and   makes   it   interesting   .   Amateur   films   appeal   to   the   voyeuristic   instinct   in   us   all   .   It   ’s   the   <br> </br>
   teenager   who   sees   the   neighbor   ’s   daughter   undressing   in   front   of   her   window   ,   the   roommate   who   secretly   watches   his   roomie   doing   it   .   It   ’s   how   the   non-pros   <br> </br>
   have   sex   and   it   is   real   and   pure   .   It   ’s   for   those   who   like   to   have   sex   and   see   someone   else   doing   it   .   To   those   who   are   about   to   embark   on   the   porn   directors   path   we   <br> </br>
   wave   our   erections   ,   harden   our   nipples   and   ready   our   sexual   juices   for   your   cinematic   dreams   and   vision   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Go   forth   and   film   the   masses   for   viewing   pleasure   ,   for   if   you   do   n’t   someone   else   will   and   you   will   be   watching   as   they   are   doing   .   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   <br> </br>

   Reason   Number   One   :   The   local   prosecutor   will   get   a   hard-on   dreaming   of   furthering   his   political   hack   career   by   trying   to   throw   your   sorry   ass   in   jail   .   This   <br> </br>
   legal   barrage   will   come   in   many   forms   ,   with   the   concerted   attempt   by   any   and   every   law   enforcement   personnel   to   throw   you   in   jail   and   make   the   headlines   in   <br> </br>
   the   local   paper   or   evening   news   .   If   the   local   prosecutor   can   not   “   constitutionally   ”   convict   you   the   next   best   thing   is   to   try   to   bankrupt   you   with   the   legal   <br> </br>
   fees   you   will   pay   in   your   defense   .   Call   up   a   local   criminal   defense   attorney   and   ask   them   how   much   they   charge   an   hour   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Do   n’t   cry   when   you   compare   it   with   your   own   hourly   wage   .   Maybe   cry   a   little   .   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   11   If   a   conviction   is   not   <br> </br>
   forthcoming   and   you   hire   a   lawyer   who   waives   the   legal   fees   to   make   a   name   for   himself   ,   the   last   desperate   attempt   of   the   persecutors   will   be   character   <br> </br>
   assassination   .   Read   further   .   Reason   Number   Two   :   Your   neighbors   and   most   “   upstanding   ”   citizens   associate   porn   directors   and   pedophiles   as   one   and   the   <br> </br>
   same   or   one   leads   to   another   .   Be   prepared   for   public   scorn   ,   public   meetings   and   public   ostrization   if   your   secret   side   job   becomes   known   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   local   clergy   will   have   a   field   day   whipping   their   followers   into   a   frothing   rage   over   the   declining   moral   standards   that   you   are   inflicting   on   their   <br> </br>
   community   .   This   will   also   help   hide   their   own   bad   publicity   over   such   touch   church   topics   such   as   embezzlement   ,   inappropriate   relations   with   <br> </br>
   parishioners   and   the   occasional   child   sex   abuse   charges   that   come   up   .   The   local   town   council   will   dream   up   laws   that   will   require   permits   or   conditions   <br> </br>
   that   you   can   not   meet   .   Do   n’t   be   surprised   if   you   get   pulled   over   by   the   local   cop   over   suspicious   circumstances   .   You   might   as   well   paint   that   target   on   your   <br> </br>
   ass   now   .   <br> </br>

   This   could   be   painful   .   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   12   Reason   Number   Three   :   If   you   ’re   doing   it   just   to   get   laid   there   are   much   <br> </br>
   better   and   less   problematic   ways   then   porn   directing   .   Go   to   Las   Vegas   and   pay   a   couple   hundred   for   a   licensed   and   disease-free   hooker   .   You   ’ll   have   saved   <br> </br>
   yourself   a   couple   thousand   dollars   and   gotten   a   nice   vacation   to   boot   .   The   casinos   will   help   you   get   rid   of   what   ’s   left   .   Do   n’t   sell   your   local   working   girls   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   We   have   heard   of   some   “   bachelor   ”   parties   that   have   gotten   pretty   pornographic   .   If   easy   sex   is   what   you   ’re   looking   for   ,   make   it   easy   ,   do   n’t   try   directing   .   <br> </br>
   The   easiest   ,   cheapest   ,   disease-free   sex   comes   from   some   lotion   and   your   hand   .   Do   n’t   sell   it   short   ,   it   ’s   the   most   reliable   method   known   to   humankind   .   Add   <br> </br>
   some   alcohol   and   a   well   directed   porn   flick   and   you   got   yourself   a   party   .   Reason   Number   Four   :   Do   you   really   have   the   time   and   preservation   to   follow   through   <br> </br>
   with   your   directing   inclinations   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Most   of   us   have   crowed   lives   as   it   is   .   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   13   Between   family   ,   work   ,   and   other   daily   requirements   just   to   <br> </br>
   get   by   ,   adding   one   more   may   not   be   an   option   .   Pardon   the   pun   but   do   n’t   get   into   it   if   you   ’re   going   to   do   it   half-assed   .   It   ’s   not   fair   to   the   actors   you   have   put   in   a   <br> </br>
   potentially   life   ruining   position   .   It   ’s   not   fair   to   the   viewing   audience   to   see   badly   filmed   sex   .   Do   n’t   ever   give   sex   a   bad   viewing   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   You   will   need   time   to   scout   out   the   location   ,   gather   the   actors   ,   check   the   equipment   ,   do   some   trial   shots   ,   do   the   editing   ,   choose   the   music   score   ,   fill   out   <br> </br>
   the   necessary   paperwork   ,   check   your   local   laws   etc   .   etc   .   etc   .   This   is   a   little   different   than   videotaping   you   and   your   main   squeeze   on   a   Saturday   night   .   Not   <br> </br>
   much   different   ,   but   still   different   .   Reason   Number   Five   :   Is   there   someone   special   in   your   life   that   you   are   either   going   to   hide   your   career   goals   from   or   <br> </br>
   share   it   with   them   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Either   one   is   a   potential   land   mine   and   given   the   opportunity   it   will   blow   up   in   your   face   .   If   you   are   currently   seeing   someone   special   but   do   n’t   think   they   <br> </br>
   could   handle   the   career   switch   ,   you   will   be   caught   and   it   wo   n’t   be   pretty   .   Chances   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   14   are   you   will   <br> </br>
   lose   them   when   they   find   out   and   it   will   be   very   hard   to   get   them   back   .   Directing   porn   films   on   the   side   ranks   up   there   with   sleeping   with   their   best   friend   ,   <br> </br>
   family   member   or   pet   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   they   tell   their   friends   or   family   why   they   broke   up   with   you   ,   the   public   relations   war   is   over   .   You   are   an   outed   pornographer   ,   you   are   slime   .   The   second   <br> </br>
   pitfall   is   collaboration   with   your   current   main   squeeze   .   What   if   they   want   to   be   a   star   ?   Could   you   direct   someone   banging   your   bedmate   ?   What   if   they   really   ,   <br> </br>
   really   like   it   and   do   n’t   want   to   stop   when   you   do   ?   What   if   the   sex   partner   their   filming   with   is   better   at   it   then   you   ?   Sexual   disease   anyone   ,   pregnancy   ,   <br> </br>
   suppressed   gay   tendencies   ?   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   If   you   ’re   not   willing   to   loose   them   then   do   n’t   start   something   that   is   bound   to   get   in   the   way   .   Reason   Number   Six   :   If   you   go   into   porn   directing   to   get   rich   ask   <br> </br>
   yourself   this   :   name   one   famous   porn   director   that   you   can   recall   .   How   much   money   do   they   have   ,   how   long   did   it   take   ?   Do   n’t   know   ,   neither   do   I.   They   are   out   <br> </br>
   there   ,   but   for   every   rich   porn   director   there   are   100   times   as   many   broke   losers   .   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   15   Distributors   <br> </br>
   pay   squat   to   porn   directors   ,   actors   and   actresses   do   n’t   come   cheap   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Dubbing   studios   have   expensive   equipment   to   pay   for   ,   camera   crew   ’s   want   more   than   a   cold   sandwich   .   Legal   fees   alone   probably   add   up   to   more   than   you   will   <br> </br>
   ever   make   .   It   ’s   not   the   money   that   brings   most   directors   in   .   It   ’s   not   even   easy   money   .   Unlike   those   spammed   e-mails   you   get   promising   overnight   riches   ,   <br> </br>
   this   book   will   not   perpetuate   a   myth   .   You   have   a   better   chance   of   winning   the   lottery   than   making   any   money   on   porn   directing   .   The   world   can   sometimes   be   a   <br> </br>
   coldhearted   bitch   .   Live   with   it   .   Reason   Number   Seven   :   What   do   you   bring   to   the   proverbially   porn   table   that   makes   you   think   you   can   direct   a   good   skin   flick   ?   <br> </br>
   Gone   to   acting   school   ,   on-again   off-again   writer   ?   Ever   write   a   screenplay   ,   ever   gone   to   your   local   dramatic   arts   theater   and   witness   a   director   in   action   ?   <br> </br>
   Good   porn   directors   have   something   to   say   about   sex   and   want   that   to   come   out   on  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> film </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   videotape   ,   digital   streaming   ,   whatever   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Poorly   shot   porn   makes   sex   look   like   what   every   religious   How   to   Become   a   Porn   Director   :   Making   Amateur   Adult   Films   16   zealots   thinks   it   is   :   dirty   ,   sick   <br> </br>
   unions   of   those   with   depraved   minds   .   Do   n’t   hurt   the   cause   by   making   bad   porn   .   Sex   is   beautiful   do   n’t   put   an   ugly   mask   on   it   by   your   own   ineptitude   .   Think   of   the   <br> </br>
   couple   that   rent   out   their   first   adult   video   to   liven   up   their   sex   lives   .   If   it   ’s   bad   you   could   cause   irreparable   damage   ,   or   at   least   make   someone   ’s   sex   life   a   <br> </br>
   little   less   interesting   and   a   little   less   frequent   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Less   sex   is   evil   ,   do   n’t   be   evil   .   Reason   Number   Eight   :   Forget   about   ever   running   for   public   office   .   Not   that   that   is   such   a   horrible   punishment   ,   but   you   have   <br> </br>
   limited   your   career   options   .   If   you   were   ever   to   run   for   city   council   ,   mayor   or   dogcatcher   ,   you   can   bet   the   political   opposition   will   find   every   movie   with   <br> </br>
