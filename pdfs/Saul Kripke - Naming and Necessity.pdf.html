   Considerable   time   has   elapsed   ,   and   I   have   come   to   realize   that   any   extensive   revision   or   expansion   would   delay   the   appearance   of   a   separate   ,   less   <br> </br>
   expensive   edition   of   Naming   and   Necessity   indefmitely   .   Further   ,   as   far   as   revision   is   concerned   ,   there   is   something   to   be   said   for   preserving   a   work   in   its   <br> </br>
   original   form   ,   warts   and   all   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>

   .   In   that   footnote   the   letter-nomenclature   for   the   yarious   objects   involved   ,   inexplicably   garbled   in   the   original   printing   ,   has   been   corrected   ;   but   I   <br> </br>
   make   no   mention   ofthe   fact   problems   which   I   did   not   know   when   I   wrote   it   and   which   The   same   considerations   lead   me   to   give   up   any   serious   to   flU   in   lacunae   ,   or   to   <br> </br>
   deal   with   serious   criticisms   or   difficulties   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   1   I   thank   Margaret   Gilbert   for   her   valuable   help   in   this   editing   .   I   Although   I   have   not   had   time   for   careful   study   of   Nathan   Salmons   criti-   Readers   who   are   new   <br> </br>
   to   this   book   can   use   the   preface   for   further   clarification   ofcertain   points   ,   and   for   a   briefhistory   of   their   genesis   .   I   would   recommend   that   such   readers   <br> </br>
   not   read   Thus   some   published   criticisms   are   not   discussed   here   because   they   are   10   frivolous   that   I   hope   they   are   not   given   wide   credence   ;   othen   because   <br> </br>
   they   are   too   substantive   ;   and   yet   other.-   simply   for   lack   of   space   .   I   leave   it   to   the   reader   to   decide   which   category   subsumes   any   panicular   example   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   the   preface   first   ,   but   that   they   return   to   it   for   clarification   (   if   necessary   )   after   they   have   read   the   main   text   .   The   preface   is   not   written   in   such   a   way   as   <br> </br>
   to   be   completely   self-contained   .   The   ideas   in   Naming   and   Necessity   evolved   in   the   early   sixties   -most   of   the   views   were   formulated   in   about   1963   -   64   .   Of   <br> </br>
   course   the   work   grew   out   ofearlier   formal   work   in   the   model   theory   ofmodal   logic   .   Already   when   I   worked   on   modal   logic   it   had   seemed   to   me   ,   as   Wiggins   has   said   <br> </br>
   ,   that   the   Leibnitzian   principle   of   the   indiscernibility   of   identicals4   was   as   selfevident   as   the   law   of   contradiction   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   That   some   philosophers   could   have   doubted   it   always   seemed   to   me   bizarre   .   The   model   theoretic   study   of   modal   logic   (   possible   worlds   semantics   )   could   only   <br> </br>
   confirm   this   conviction-the   alleged   counterexamples   involving   modal   properties   always   turned   out   to   turn   on   some   confusion   :   the   contexts   involved   did   <br> </br>
   not   express   genuine   properties   ,   scopes   were   confused   ,   or   coincidence   between   individual   concepts   was   confused   with   identity   between   individuals   .   The   <br> </br>
   model   theory   made   this   completely   clear   ,   though   it   should   have   been   clear   enough   on   the   intuitive   level   .   Waiving   fussy   considerations   deriving   from   the   <br> </br>
   fact   that   x   need   not   have   necessary   existence   ,   it   was   clear   from   (   x   )   0   (   x   x   )   and   Leibnitzs   law   that   identity   is   an   internal   relation   :   (   x   )   (   y   )   (   x   y   :   :   :   :   0   X   y   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   What   pairs   (   x   ,   y   )   could   be   counterexamples   ?   Not   pairs   ofdistinct   objects   ,   for   then   the   antecedent   is   false   ;   nor   any   pair   of   an   object   and   itselr   :   for   then   <br> </br>
   the   consequent   is   true   .   )   If   a   and   b   are   rigid   desigators   ,   it   follows   that   a   b   ,   if   true   ,   is   a   necessary   truth   .   If   a   and   b   are   not   rigid   designators   ,   no   such   <br> </br>
   conclusion   follows   about   the   statement   a   b   (   though   the   objects   designated   by   a   and   b   will   be   necessarily   identical   )   .   In   speaking   of   rigid   designators   ,   we   <br> </br>
   are   speaking   of   a   Eventually   I   came   to   realize-this   realization   inaugurated   the   aforementioned   work   of   1963   -   64-that   the   received   presuppositions   <br> </br>
   against   the   necessity   ofidentities   between   ordinary   names   were   incorrect   ,   that   the   natural   intuition   that   the   names   ofordinary   language   are   rigid   <br> </br>
   designators   can   in   fact   be   upheld.1i   Part   of   the   effort   to   make   this   clear   involved   the   distinction   between   using   a   description   to   give   a   meaning   and   using   <br> </br>
   it   to   fix   a   reference   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   at   this   stage   I   rejected   the   conventional   description   theory   as   an   account   of   meaning   ,   though  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> its </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> validity </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> as   an   account   of   the   fixing   of   a   reference </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> was   left   untouched </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Probably   I   let   myself   be   content   with   this   position   momentarily   ,   but   the   natural   next   step   was   to   question   whether   the   description   theory   gave   a   correct   <br> </br>
   account   even   of   how   the   references   ofnames   were   fixed   .   The   result   appears   in   the   second   of   these   lectures   .   It   was   a   short   step   to   realize   that   similar   <br> </br>
   remarks   applied   to   terms   for   natural   kinds   .   The   other   leading   ideas   came   naturally   as   things   fit   into   place   .   Let   me   not   pay   inadequate   tribute   to   the   power   <br> </br>
   of   the   then   prevailing   complex   of   ideas   ,   emanating   from   Frege   and   from   Russell   ,   that   I   then   abandoned   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   natural   and   uniform   manner   by   which   these   ideas   appear   to   account   for   a   variety   of   philosophical   problems-their   marvelous   internal   coherenceis   <br> </br>
   adequate   explanation   for   their   long   appeal   .   I   myselfhave   been   shocked   at   the   prevalence   of   some   ideas   in   the   philosophical   community   which   to   me   have   <br> </br>
   little   or   no   appeal   ,   but   I   have   never   placed   the   description   theory   of   proper   names   in   such   a   category   .   Although   I   ,   with   others   ,   always   felt   some   strain   in   <br> </br>
   this   edifice   ,   it   took   some   time   to   get   free   ofits   seductive   power   .   6   It   also   became   clear   that   a   symbol   of   any   actual   or   hypothetical   language   that   is   not   a   <br> </br>
   rigid   designator   is   so   unlike   the   names   of   ordinary   language   that   it   ought   not   to   be   called   a   name   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   particular   ,   this   would   apply   to   a   hypothetical   abbreviation   of   a   nonrigid   definite   description   .   Although   the   idea   is   now   a   familiar   one   ,   I   will   give   a   <br> </br>
   brief   restatement   of   the   idea   of   rigid   designation   ,   and   the   intuition   about   names   that   underlies   it   .   Consider   :   That   is   everyone   ,   even   Russell   ,   would   <br> </br>
   agree   that   this   is   a   true   material   equivalence   ,   given   that   there   really   was   an   Aristotle   .   7   In   particular   ,   we   ignore   the   question   what   to   say   about   <br> </br>
   counterfactual   situations   in   which   Aristotle   would   not   have   existed   .   See   page   21   note   21   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Taking   the   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   to   be   the   description   Russell   associates   with   Aristotle   .   Let   admirers   of   Epicureanism   ,   Stoicism   ,   etc   .   ,   <br> </br>
   not   be   offended   ;   if   any   reader   thinks   that   someone   later   than   Aristotle   is   the   true   referent   ofthe   description   given   ,   let   that   reader   substitute   another   <br> </br>
   one   .   (   2   )   The   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   was   fond   of   dogs   ,   and   that   this   in   turn   should   be   analyzed   as   (   3   )   Exactly   one   person   was   last   among   the   great   <br> </br>
   philo-   So   far   I   have   said   nothing   that   I   did   not   think   I   had   made   clear   before   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   it   should   be   apparent   from   the   explanation   that   some   criticisms   are   misunderstandings   .   Some   have   thought   that   the   simple   fact   that   two   people   can   have   <br> </br>
   the   same   name   refutes   the   rigidity   thesis   .   It   is   true   that   in   the   present   monograph   I   spoke   for   simplicity   as   if   each   name   had   a   unique   bearer   .   I   do   not   in   fact   <br> </br>
   think   ,   as   far   as   the   issue   of   rigidity   is   concerned   ,   that   this   is   a   major   oversimplification   .   I   believe   that   many   important   theoretical   issues   about   the   <br> </br>
   semantics   of   names   (   probably   not   all   )   would   be   largely   unaffected   had   our   conventions   required   that   no   two   things   shall   be   given   the   same   name   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   particular   ,   as   I   shall   explain   ,   the   issue   of   rigidity   would   be   unaffected   .   For   language   as   we   have   it   ,   we   could   speak   of   names   as   having   a   unique   referent   <br> </br>
   if   we   adopted   a   terminology   ,   anal-   Jr.   ,   and   Howard   K.   Wettstein   ,   University   of   Minnesota   Press   ,   Minneapolis   (   1979   )   ,   pp   .   6   -   27   )   for   a   brief   discussion   of   <br> </br>
   the   relation   of   the   idea   of   rigid   defmite   descriptions   to   Donnellans   referential   descriptions   .   I   also   discuss   the   relation   of   both   of   these   to   the   notion   <br> </br>
   of   scope   .   10   Eut   perhaps   one   use   of   How   many   names   are   there   in   this   telephone   book   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   ?   is   an   exception   (   Anne   Jacobson   )   .   11   Ey   using   this   term   ,   I   do   not   mean   to   commie   the   analysis   to   a   particular   view   (   see   also   the   next   footnote   )   ,   though   I   <br> </br>
   suggest   my   own   .   I   mean   simply   that   two   people   can   have   phonetically   the   same   name   .   ogous   to   the   practice   of   calling   homonyms   distinct   words   ,   according   to   <br> </br>
   which   uses   of   phonetically   the   same   sOWlds   to   nam   :   distinct   objects   count   as   distinct   names.8   This   terminology   cert.aml   !   does   not   agree   with   the   most   <br> </br>
   common   usage,10   but   I   thmk   It   may   have   a   great   deal   to   recommend   it   for   theoretical   purposes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   main   point   is   that   ,   however   <br> </br>

As   a   speaker   ofmy   idiolect   ,   I   call   only   ne   oject   Aristotle   ,   though   I   am   aware   that   other   people   ,   <br> </br>
   mcludmg   the   man   I   call   Onassis   or   perhaps   AristotleOnassis   ,   had   the   same   given   name   .   Other   readers   may   use   Aristotle   to   name   more   than   one   object   (   person   ,   <br> </br>
   or   pet   animal   )   and   for   them   (   I   )   has   no   unambiguous   truth   conditions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   I   spoke   of   the   truth   conditions   of   (   I   )   ,   I   perforce   assum.;d   a   particular   reading   for   (   I   )   .   (   So   of   course   ,   does   the   classical   description   theorist   ;   this   <br> </br>
   is   not   an   issue   between   us   .   Classical   description   theorists   ,   too   ,   tended   to   speak   for   simplicity   as   if   names   had   he   were   right   ,   fail   to   conform   to   the   rule   <br> </br>
   ofrigidity   .   That   is   ,   no   rigidly   .   )   That   more   than   one   proposition   may   be   expressed   by   (   I   )   is   irrelevant   :   the   question   is   whether   each   such   proposition   is   <br> </br>
   evaluated   as   I   describe   ,   or   is   it   not   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   view   applies   linguistic   practice   allows   two   things   to   have   phonetically   the   same   name   need   not   be   settled   for   this   to   be   clear.u   scope   ,   which   <br> </br>
   apparently   I   treated   too   briefly   .   It   seems   often   to   be   supposed   that   all   the   linguistic   intuitions   I   adduce   on   behalf   of   rigidity   could   just   as   well   be   <br> </br>
   handled   by   reading   nan.les   in   analogously   to   wide   scope   descriptions   .   It   would   ,   indeed   ,   be   graph   .   To   this   extent   the   objection   is   justified   ,   butit   seems   <br> </br>
   to   me   to   be   wrong   to   suppose   that   all   our   intuitions   can   be   handled   in   this   way   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> I   dealt   with   the   question   rather   briefly   ,   on   page   62   and   in   the   accompanying   footnote   25 </span>  ,   but  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> discussion </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> seems   to   have   been   overlooked   by   many   readers </span>  .   <br> </br>
   In   the   footnote   I   13   See   Michael   Dummett   ,   Frcge   (   Duckworth   ,   1973   )   ,   p.   128   .   Unfortunately   ,   many   ofDummetts   other   ideas   or   remarks   on   the   relation   of   <br> </br>
   rigidity   to   scope   are   technically   erroneous-for   example   ,   on   the   same   page   he   says   that   I   hold   that   descriptions   arc   never   (   ?   )   rigid   and   equates   this   view   <br> </br>
   with   the   claim   that   within   a   modal   context   ,   the   scope   ofa   definite   description   should   always   be   taken   to   exclude   the   modal   operator   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Also   ,   some   of   his   comments   on   linguistic   intuitions   seem   to   me   to   be   in   error   .   I   can   not   deal   with   these   matters   here   .   adduce   some   linguistic   phenomena   that   ,   <br> </br>
   I   think   ,   support   the   scope   .   Many   of   these   readers   even   seem   to   have   overlooked   the   intuitive   test   for   rigidity   ,   as   emphasized   on   pages   48   -   49   .   I   will   not   <br> </br>
   repeat   or   elaborate   these   considerations   in   this   preface   ,   even   though   they   seem   to   have   been   stated   too   briefly   .   Exigencies   of   a   preface   may   make   the   <br> </br>

   I   shall   discuss   the   scope   question   in   the   light   of   the   present   explanation   of   rigidity   .   It   has   even   been   asserted   that   my   own   view   itself   reduces   to   a   view   <br> </br>
   about   scope   ,   that   the   doctrine   of   rigidity   simply   is   the   doctrine   that   natural   language   has   a   convention   that   a   name   ,   in   the   context   of   any   sentence   ,   should   <br> </br>
   be   read   with   a   large   scope   including   all   modal   operators   ,   l3   This   latter   idea   is   par-   ticularly   wide   ofthe   mark   ;   in   terms   ofmodal   logic   ,   it   represents   a   <br> </br>
   technical   error   .   Let   me   deal   with   it   first   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   I   )   and   (   2   )   are   simple   sentences   .   Neither   contains   modal   or   other   operators   ,   convention   about   more   complex   sentences   affects   the   inter-   pretation   of   <br> </br>
   these   sentences   .   Yet   the   issue   of   rigidity   makes   11   The   thesis   that   names   are   rigid   in   simple   sentences   is   ,   however   ,   equivalent   (   ignoring   complications   <br> </br>
   arising   from   the   possible   nonexistence   of   the   object   )   to   the   thesis   that   if   a   modal   operator   govenu   a   simple   sc   :   ntence   containing   a   name   ,   the   two   readings   <br> </br>
   with   large   and   small   scopes   are   equivalent   .   This   is   not   the   same   as   the   doctrine   that   narurallanguage   has   a   convention   that   only   the   large   scope   reading   is   <br> </br>
   allowed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   fact   ,   the   equivalence   makes   sense   only   for   a   language   \\   here   both   readings   are   admissible   .   (   4   )   What   (   I   )   expresses   might   have   been   the   case   .   Doent   .   his   <br> </br>
   express   the   desired   assertion   ,   with   no   scope   ambIguIties   ?   If   not   ,   what   would   do   so   ?   (   The   formulation   might   be   a   bit   more   natural   in   a   dialogue   :   Aristotle   <br> </br>
   was   fond   of   dogs   .   That   s   not   the   case   ,   though   it   might   have   been   .   )   Now   my   claim   is   that   our   understanding   of(4   )   conforms   to   the   theory   of   rigidity   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   No   possible   situation   in   which   anyone   but   Aristotle   himself   was   fond   of   dogs   can   be   relevant   .   necessity   and   contingency   ,   and   that   to   fix   a   reference   is   not   <br> </br>
   to   give   a   synonym   .   More   important   ,   this   situation   indicated   that   the   evidence   ordinarily   adduced   to   show   that   names   were   I   will   say   something   briefly   <br> </br>
   about   possible   worlds.16   (   I   hope   to   elaborate   elsewhere   .   )   In   the   present   monograph   I   argued   But   I   do   not   wish   to   leave   any   exaggerated   impression   that   I   <br> </br>
   repudiate   possible   worlds   altogether   ,   or   even   that   I   regard   them   as   a   xnere   formal   dc   :   vice   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   My   own   use   of   them   should   have   been   extensive   enough   to   preclude   any   such   misunderstanding   .   In   fact   ,   there   are   some   conceptions   of   possible   worlds   that   I   <br> </br>
   repudiate   and   some   I   do   not   .   An   analogy   from   school-in   fact   ,   it   is   not   merely   an   analogy-will   help   to   clarify   my   view   .   Two   ordinary   dice   (   call   them   die   A   and   <br> </br>
   die   B   )   are   thrown   ,   displaying   two   numbers   face   up   .   For   each   die   ,   there   are   six   possible   results   .   Hence   there   are   thirty-six   possible   states   of   the   pair   of   <br> </br>
   dice   ,   as   far   as   the   numbers   shown   face-up   are   concerned   ,   though   only   one   of   these   states   corresponds   to   the   way   the   dice   actually   will   come   out   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>

   .   Now   in   doing   these   school   exercises   in   probability   ,   we   were   in   fact   introduced   at   a   tender   age   to   a   set   of(miniature   )   possible   worlds   .   The   thirty-six   <br> </br>
   possible   states   of   the   dice   are   literally   thirty-six   possible   worlds   ,   as   long   as   we   (   fictively   )   ignore   everything   about   the   world   except   the   two   dice   and   <br> </br>
   what   they   show   (   and   ignore   the   fact   that   one   or   both   dice   might   not   have   existed   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Only   one   of   these   miniworlds-the   one   corresponding   to   the   way   the   dice   in   fact   come   up-is   the   actual   world   ,   but   the   others   are   of   interest   when   we   ask   how   <br> </br>
   probable   or   improbable   the   actual   outcome   was   (   or   will   be   )   .   Now   in   this   elementary   case   ,   certain   confusions   can   be   avoided   .   We   have   assumed   that   the   dice   <br> </br>
   actually   do   fall   ,   that   some   one   ofthe   thirty-six   states   is   actual   .   Now   the   actual   world   in   this   case   is   the   state   of   the   dice   that   is   actually   realized   .   <br> </br>
   Another   entity   ,   more   concrete   than   this   state   ,   is   the   Lesniewskian-Goodmanian   physical   entity   which   is   the   sum   of   the   two   dice   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   This   complex   physical   entity   (   the   dice   ,   thought   of   as   a   single   object   )   is   before   me   on   the   table   ,   after   the   throw   ,   and   its   actual   position   determines   the   <br> </br>
   actual   state   of   the   (   two   )   dice   .   But   when   we   talk   in   school   of   thirty-six   possibilities   ,   in   no   way   do   we   need   to   posit   that   there   are   some   thirty-five   other   <br> </br>
   entities   ,   existent   in   some   never-never   land   ,   corresponding   to   the   physical   object   before   me   .   Nor   need   we   ask   whether   these   phantom   entities   are   composed   <br> </br>
   of   (   phantom   )   counterparts   of   the   actual   individual   dice   ,   or   are   somehow   composed   of   the   same   individual   dice   themselves   but   in   another   dimension   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   thirty-six   possibilities   ,   the   one   that   is   actual   included   ,   are   (   abstract   )   states   of   the   dice   ,   not   complex   physical   entities   .   Nor   should   any   school   <br> </br>
   pupil   receive   high   marks   for   the   question   How   do   we   know   ,   in   the   state   where   die   A   is   six   and   die   B   is   five   ,   whether   it   is   die   A   or   die   B   which   is   six   ?   Do   nt   we   need   a   <br> </br>
   criterion   of   transstate   identity   to   identify   the   die   with   a   six-not   the   die   with   a   five-with   our   die   A   ?   The   answer   is   ,   of   course   ,   that   the   state   (   die   A   ,   6   ;   die   B   <br> </br>
   ,   S   )   is   given   as   such   (   and   distinguished   from   the   state   (   die   B   ,   6   ;   die   A   ,   S   )   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   demand   for   some   further   criterion   of   transstate   identity   is   so   confused   that   no   competent   schoolchild   would   be   so   perversely   philosophical   as   to   make   <br> </br>
   it   .   The   possibilities   simply   are   not   given   purely   qualitatively   (   as   in   :   one   die   ,   6   ,   the   other   ,   s   )   .   If   they   had   been   ,   there   would   have   been   just   twentyone   <br> </br>
   distinct   possibilities   ,   not   thirty-six   .   And   the   states   are   not   phantom   dice-pairs   ,   viewed   from   afar   ,   about   which   we   can   raise   epistemically   meaningful   <br> </br>
   questions   of   the   form   ,   Which   die   is   that   ?   Nor   ,   when   we   regard   such   qualitatively   identical   states   as   (   A   ,   6   ;   B   ,   S   )   and   (   A   ,   s   ;   B   ,   6   )   as   distinct   ,   need   we   suppose   <br> </br>
   that   A   and   B   are   qualitatively   distinguishable   in   some   other   respect   ,   say   ,   color   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   On   the   contrary   ,   for   the   purposes   of   the   probability   problem   ,   the   numerical   face   shown   is   thought   of   as   if   it   were   the   only   property   ofeach   die   .   Finally   ,   in   <br> </br>
   setting   up   this   innocent   little   exercise   regarding   the   fall   of   te   dice   ,   with   possibilities   that   are   not   described   purely   qualitatively   ,   we   make   no   <br> </br>
   obscure   metaphysical   commitment   to   dice   as   bare   particulars   ,   whatever   that   might   mean   .   !   ?   Concerning   rigidity   :   In   many   places   ,   both   in   this   preface   and   <br> </br>
   in   the   text   of   this   monograph   ,   I   deliberately   ignore   delicate   questions   arising   from   the   possible   nonexistence   of   an   object   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   also   ignore   the   distinction   between   de   jure   rigidity   ,   where   the   refercnce   of   a   designator   is   stipulated   to   be   a   single   object   ,   whether   we   are   speaking   of   <br> </br>
   the   actual   world   or   of   a   counterfactual   situation   ,   and   mcre   de   facto   rigidity   ,   whcre   a   description   the   x   such   that   Fx   happens   to   use   a   predicate   F   that   in   each   <br> </br>
   possible   world   is   true   ofone   and   the   same   unique   object   (   e.g.   ,   the   smallest   prime   rigidly   designates   the   number   two   )   .   Clearly   my   thesis   about   names   is   that   <br> </br>
   they   are   rigid   de   jure   ,   but   in   the   monograph   I   am   content   with   the   weakcr   assertion   of   rigidity   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Since   names   Me   rigid   de   jure-see   p.   78   below-I   say   that   a   proper   name   rigidly   designates   its   referent   even   when   we   speak   of   counterfactual   situations   where   <br> </br>
   that   referent   would   not   have   existed   .   Thus   the   issues   about   nonexistence   are   affected   .   Various   people   have   persuaded   me   that   all   these   questions   deserve   <br> </br>
   a   more   careful   discussion   than   I   gave   them   in   the   monograph   ,   but   I   must   leave   thcm   here   .   that   surrounds   us   .   The   latter   might   also   have   been   called   the   (   actual   <br> </br>
   )   world   ,   but   it   is   not   the   relevant   object   here   .   Thus   the   possible   but   not   actual   worlds   are   not   phantom   duplicates   of   the   world   in   this   other   sense   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Perhaps   such   confusions   would   have   been   less   likely   but   for   the   terminological   accident   that   possible   worlds   rather   than   possible   states   ,   or   histories   ,   <br> </br>
   of   the   world   ,   or   counterfactual   situations   had   been   used   .   Certainly   they   would   have   been   avoided   had   philosophers   adhered   to   the   common   practices   of   <br> </br>
   schoolchildren   and   probabilists   .   I   1   In   January   of   1970   ,   I   gave   three   talks   at   Princeton   University   transcribed   here   .   As   the   style   of   the   transcript   makes   <br> </br>
   clear   ,   I   gave   the   talks   without   a   written   text   ,   and   ,   in   fact   ,   without   notes   .   The   present   text   is   lightly.edited   from   the   lIbatjm   transcript   ;   an   occasional   <br> </br>
   passage   has   been   added   to   expand   the   thought   ,   an   occasional   sentence   has   been   rewritten   ,   but   no   attempt   has   been   made   to   change   the   informal   style   of   the   <br> </br>
   original   .   <br> </br>
