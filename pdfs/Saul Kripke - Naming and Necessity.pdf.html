   Necessity   extensively   .   Considerable   time   has   elapsed   ,   and   I   have   come   to   realize   that   any   extensive   revision   or   expansion   would   delay   the   appearance   of   a   <br> </br>
   separate   ,   less   expensive   edition   of   Naming   and   Necessity   indefmitely   .   Further   ,   as   far   as   revision   is   concerned   ,   there   is   something   to   be   said   for   <br> </br>
   preserving   a   work   in   its   original   form   ,   warts   and   all   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   have   thus   followed   a   very   conservative   policy   of   correction   for   the   present   printing   .   Obvious   printing   errors   have   been   corrected   ,   and   slight   changes   <br> </br>
   have   been   made   to   make   various   sentences   or   formulations   clearer   .   l   A   good   indication   of   my   conservative   policy   is   in   fOltnote   56   .   In   that   footnote   the   <br> </br>
   letter-nomenclature   for   the   yarious   objects   involved   ,   inexplicably   garbled   in   the   original   printing   ,   has   been   corrected   but   I   make   no   mention   ofthe   <br> </br>
   fact   that   the   argument   of   the   footnote   now   seems   to   me   to   have   problems   which   I   did   not   know   when   I   wrote   it   and   which   at   least   require   further   discussion.2   The   <br> </br>
   same   considerations   lead   me   to   give   up   any   serious   attempt   to   use   this   preface   to   amplify   my   previous   argument   ,   to   flU   in   lacunae   ,   or   to   deal   with   serious   <br> </br>
   criticisms   or   difficulties   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   1   I   thank   Margaret   Gilbert   for   her   valuable   help   in   this   editing   .   I   Although   I   have   not   had   time   for   careful   study   of   Nathan   Salmons   criti-   cism   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   703   -   25   )   of   this   footnote   ,   it   seems   likely   that   his   criticism   of   the   argument   ,   though   related   to   mine   ,   is   not   the   same   and   reconstructs   it   in   a   way   that   does   <br> </br>
   not   correspond   to   my   exact   intent   and   makes   the   argument   wmecessarily   weak   .   Also   ,   I   think   I   had   no   ambition   in   this   short   footnote   rigorously   to   prove   <br> </br>
   essentialism   from   the   theory   of   reference   alone   .   The   footnote   was   so   compressed   that   readers   might   easily   reconstruct   the   details   in   differing   ways   .   <br> </br>
   Obviously   ,   aside   from   such   amplification   in   the   preface   ,   there   are   passages   in   the   monograph   other   than   just   footnote   56   that   I   might   modify   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   do   stand   by   the   principal   theses   of   my   work   ,   and   the   pressure   for   much   revision   is   not   intense   .   I   will   ,   however   ,   use   this   preface   briefly   to   describe   the   <br> </br>
   background   and   genesis   of   the   leading   ideas   of   this   monograph   ,   and   to   discuss   a   few   misapprehensions   that   seem   to   be   common   .   I   am   afraid   that   I   must   <br> </br>
   disappoint   those   readers   who   already   found   the   exposition   in   the   monograph   satisfactory   on   these   points   .   Relatively   little   will   be   added   to   deal   with   <br> </br>
   what   I   see   as   the   more   substantive   problems   of   the   monograph   .   The   issues   explained   further-mostly   related   to   modality   and   rigid   designation-may   already   <br> </br>
   have   been   clear   to   most   readers   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   On   the   other   hand   ,   those   readers   who   felt   sympathetic   to   some   of   the   objections   mentioned   here   may   well   be   justified   in   wishing   for   a   more   thorough   <br> </br>
   treatment   .   I   fear   that   in   most   cases   ,   the   treatment   ofdisputed   points   allowable   in   the   space   of   a   preface   is   simply   too   short   to   convince   many   readers   who   <br> </br>
   were   inclined   to   believe   the   objections   .   To   some   extent   ,   brief   treatments   of   objections   may   do   more   harm   than   good   ,   since   the   reader   who   was   confused   may   <br> </br>
   think   that   if   this   is   all   that   can   be   replied   ,   the   original   objection   must   have   been   cogent   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Nevertheless   ,   I   thought   I   should   register   briefly   why   I   think   certain   reactions   are   misconceived   .   I   hope   that   in   some   cases   I   will   be   able   to   write   at   <br> </br>
   greater   length   .   Here   I   must   plead   that   a   thorough   discussion   is   impossible   within   the   bounds   of   this   preface   .   Readers   who   are   new   to   this   book   can   use   the   <br> </br>
   preface   for   further   clarification   ofcertain   points   ,   and   for   a   briefhistory   of   their   genesis   .   I   would   recommend   that   such   readers   not   read   Thus   some   <br> </br>
   published   criticisms   are   not   discussed   here   because   they   are   10   frivolous   that   I   hope   they   are   not   given   wide   credence   othen   because   they   are   too   <br> </br>
   substantive   and   yet   other.-   simply   for   lack   of   space   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   leave   it   to   the   reader   to   decide   which   category   subsumes   any   panicular   example   .   F   the   preface   first   ,   but   that   they   return   to   it   for  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> clarification   (   if </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> necessary   ) </span>  after   they   have   read   the   main   text   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   preface   is   not   written   in   such   a   way   as   to   be   completely   self-contained   .   The   ideas   in   Naming   and   Necessity   evolved   in   the   early   sixties   -most   of   the   views   <br> </br>
   were   formulated   in   about   1963   -   64   .   Of   course   the   work   grew   out   ofearlier   formal   work   in   the   model   theory   ofmodal   logic   .   Already   when   I   worked   on   modal   logic   <br> </br>
   it   had   seemed   to   me   ,   as   Wiggins   has   said   ,   that   the   Leibnitzian   principle   of   the   indiscernibility   of   identicals4   was   as   selfevident   as   the   law   of   <br> </br>
   contradiction   .   That   some   philosophers   could   have   doubted   it   always   seemed   to   me   bizarre   .   <br> </br>

   rigidity   are   relevant   ,   see   page   21n   .   21   the   analogous   deduction   for   nonrigid   designators   is   fallacious   .   )   From   (   ii   )   all   that   strictly   follows   about   <br> </br>
   so-called   names   in   natural   language   is   that   either   they   are   not   rigid   or   true   identities   between   them   are   necessary   .   Our   intuitive   idea   of   naming   suggests   <br> </br>
   that   names   are   rigid   ,   but   I   suppose   that   at   one   time   I   vaguely   supposed   ,   influenced   by   prevailing   presuppositions   ,   that   since   obviously   there   are   <br> </br>
   contingent   identities   between   ordinary   so-called   names   ,   such   ordinary   names   must   not   be   rigid   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   ,   it   was   already   clear   from   (i)-without   any   investigation   of   natural   language-that   the   supposition   ,   common   to   philosophical   discussions   of   <br> </br>
   materialism   at   that   time   ,   that   objects   can   be   contingently   identical   ,   is   false   .   Identity   would   be   an   internal   relation   even   if   natural   language   had   <br> </br>
   contained   no   rigid   designators   .   The   confused   reference   to   objects   as   contingently   identical   served   illegitimately   as   a   philosophical   crutch   :   It   <br> </br>
   enabled   philosophers   simultaneously   to   think   ofcertain   designators   as   if   they   were   non-rigid  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   and   hence   found   in   contingent   identities   ) </span>  and   as   if   they   <br> </br>
   were   rigid   ,   the   conflict   being   muddled   over   by   thinking   of   the   corresponding   objects   as   contingently   identical   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Even   before   I   clearly   realized   the   true   situation   regarding   proper   names   ,   I   felt   little   sympathy   for   the   dark   doctrine   of   a   relation   of   contingent   <br> </br>
   identity   .   Uniquely   identifying   properties   can   coincide   contingently   ,   but   objects   can   not   be   contingently   identical   .   Eventually   I   came   to   <br> </br>
   realize-this   realization   inaugurated   the   aforementioned   work   of   1963   -   64-that   the   received   presuppositions   against   the   necessity   ofidentities   <br> </br>
   between   ordinary   names   were   incorrect   ,   that   the   natural   intuition   that   the   names   ofordinary   language   are   rigid   designators   can   in   fact   be   upheld.1i   Part   <br> </br>
   of   the   effort   to   make   this   clear   involved   the   distinction   between   using   a   description   to   give   a   meaning   and   using   it   to   fix   a   reference   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   at   this   stage   I   rejected   the   conventional   description   theory   as   an   account   of   meaning   ,   though   its   validity   as   an   account   of   the   fixing   of   a   reference   <br> </br>
   was   left   untouched   .   Probably   I   let   myself   be   content   with   this   position   momentarily   ,   but   the   natural   next   step   was   to   question   whether   the   description   <br> </br>
   theory   gave   a   correct   account   even   of   how   the   references   ofnames   were   fixed   .   The   result   appears   in   the   second   of   these   lectures   .   It   was   a   short   step   to   <br> </br>
   realize   that   similar   remarks   applied   to   terms   for   natural   kinds   .   The   other   leading   ideas   came   naturally   as   things   fit   into   place   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Let   me   not   pay   inadequate   tribute   to   the   power   of   the   then   prevailing   complex   of   ideas   ,   emanating   from   Frege   and   from   Russell   ,   that   I   then   abandoned   .   The   <br> </br>
   natural   and   uniform   manner   by   which   these   ideas   appear   to   account   for   a   variety   of   philosophical   problems-their   marvelous   internal   coherenceis   <br> </br>
   adequate   explanation   for   their   long   appeal   .   I   myselfhave   been   shocked   at   the   prevalence   of   some   ideas   in   the   philosophical   community   which   to   me   have   <br> </br>
   little   or   no   appeal   ,   but   I   have   never   placed   the   description   theory   of   proper   names   in   such   a   category   .   Although   I   ,   with   others   ,   always   felt   some   strain   in   <br> </br>
   this   edifice   ,   it   took   some   time   to   get   free   ofits   seductive   power   .   <br> </br>

   Presumably   everyone   agrees   that   there   is   a   certain   man-the   philosopher   we   call   Aristotle-such   that   ,   as   a   matter   of   fact   ,   (   I   )   is   true   if   and   only   if   he   was   <br> </br>

   obtained   .   (   Forget   the   counterfactual   situations   where   he   would   not   have   existed   .   )   By   contrast   ,   Russell   thinks   that   (   I   )   should   be   analyzed   as   something   <br> </br>
   like:8   That   is   everyone   ,   even   Russell   ,   would   agree   that   this   is   a   true   material   equivalence   ,   given   that   there   really   was   an   Aristotle   .   7   In   particular   ,   we   <br> </br>
   ignore   the   question   what   to   say   about   counterfactual   situations   in   which   Aristotle   would   not   have   existed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   See   page   21   note   21   .   Taking   the   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   to   be   the   description   Russell   associates   with   Aristotle   .   Let   admirers   of   Epicureanism   <br> </br>
   ,   Stoicism   ,   etc   .   ,   not   be   offended   if   any   reader   thinks   that   someone   later   than   Aristotle   is   the   true   referent   ofthe   description   given   ,   let   that   reader   <br> </br>
   substitute   another   one   .   I   assume   Russell   is   .   right   in   that   defmite   descriptions   can   at   least   sometimes   be   interpreted   nonrigidly   .   As   I   mention   on   page   59   <br> </br>
   footnote   22   ,   some   philosophers   think   that   ,   in   addition   ,   there   is   a   rigid   sense   of   defmite   descriptions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   I   say   in   the   latter   footnote   ,   I   am   not   convinced   of   this   ,   but   if   these   philosophers   are   right   ,   my   principal   thesis   is   not   affected   .   It   contrasts   names   with   <br> </br>

   6   -   27   )   for   a   brief   discussion   of   the   relation   of   the   idea   of   rigid   defmite   descriptions   to   Donnellans   referential   descriptions   .   I   also   discuss   the   <br> </br>
   relation   of   both   of   these   to   the   notion   of   scope   .   I   Actually   ,   the   criterion   should   be   subtler   ,   and   depends   on   ones   theoretical   views   .   Thus   ,   on   the   picture   <br> </br>
   advocated   in   this   monograph   ,   two   totally   distinct   historical   chains   that   by   sheer   accident   assign   phonetically   the   same   name   to   the   same   man   should   <br> </br>
   probably   count   as   creating   distinct   names   despite   the   identity   of   the   referents   .   The   identity   may   well   be   unknown   to   the   speaker   ,   or   express   a   recent   <br> </br>
   discovery   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   Similarly   ,   a   description   theorist   who   counts   names   in   the   way   suggested   presumably   would   regard   two   phonetically   identical   names   with   distinct   <br> </br>
   associated   descriptions   as   distinct   ,   even   if   the   two   descriptions   happen   uniquely   to   be   true   of   the   same   object   .   )   But   distinctness   of   the   referents   will   <br> </br>
   be   a   s!fficienl   condition   for   distinctness   of   the   names   .   I   should   stress   that   I   am   not   demanding   or   even   advocating   this   usage   ,   but   mention   it   as   a   <br> </br>
   possibility   to   which   I   am   sympathetic   .   The   point   that   rigidity   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   question   of   two   people   having   phonetically   the   same   name   holds   <br> </br>
   whether   this   convention   is   adopted   or   not   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   10   Eut   perhaps   one   use   of   How   many   names   are   there   in   this   telephone   book   ?   is  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> an </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> exception </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   Anne   Jacobson   ) </span>  .   <br> </br>

   11   Ey   using   this   term   ,   I   do   not   mean   to   commie   the   analysis   to   a   particular   view   (   see   also   the   next   footnote   )   ,   though   I   suggest   my   own   .   I   mean   simply   that   two   <br> </br>
   people   can   have   phonetically   the   same   name   .   ogous   to   the   practice   of   calling   homonyms   distinct   words   ,   according   to   which   uses   of   phonetically   the   same   <br> </br>
   sOWlds   to   nam   :   distinct   objects   count   as   distinct   names.8   This   terminology   cert.aml   !   does   not   agree   with   the   most   common   usage,10   but   I   thmk   It   may   have   a   <br> </br>
   great   deal   to   recommend   it   for   theoretical   purposes   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   the   main   point   is   that   ,   however   a   philosophical   theory   may   treat   such   homonymousll   names   ,   the   issue   is   irrelevant   to   the   question   of   rigidity   .   As   a   <br> </br>
   speaker   ofmy   idiolect   ,   I   call   only   ne   oject   Aristotle   ,   though   I   am   aware   that   other   people   ,   mcludmg   the   man   I   call   Onassis   or   perhaps   AristotleOnassis   ,   had   <br> </br>
   the   same   given   name   .   Other   readers   may   use   Aristotle   to   name   more   than  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> one </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> object </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> (   person   ,   or   pet   animal   ) </span>  and   for   them   (   I   )   has   no   unambiguous   truth   <br> </br>
   conditions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   When   I   spoke   of   the   truth   conditions   of   (   I   )   ,   I   perforce   assum   .   d   a   particular   reading   for   (   I   )   .   (   So   of   course   ,   does   the   classical   description   theorist   this   is   <br> </br>
   not   an   issue   between   us   .   Classical   description   theorists   ,   too   ,   tended   to   speak   for   simplicity   as   if   names   had   Wlique   references   .   )   In   practice   it   is   usual   <br> </br>
   to   suppose   that   what   is   meant   in   a   particular   use   of   a   sentence   is   understood   from   the   context   .   In   the   present   instance   ,   that   context   made   it   clear   that   it   was   <br> </br>

   <br> </br>
   Then   ,   given   this   fixed   understanding   of   (   I   )   ,   the   question   of   rigidity   is   :   Is   the   correctness   of   (   I   )   ,   thus   understood   ,   determined   with   respect   to   each   <br> </br>
