   <br> </br>
   I   Lecture   II   Lecture   III   Addenda   I   22   71   106   Originally   I   had   intended   to   revise   or   augment   Naming   and   Necessity   extensively   .   Considerable   time   has   elapsed   <br> </br>
   ,   and   I   have   come   to   realize   that   any   extensive   revision   or   expansion   would   delay   the   appearance   of   a   separate   ,   less   expensive   edition   of   Naming   and   <br> </br>
   Necessity   indefmitely   .   Further   ,   as   far   as   revision   is   concerned   ,   there   is   something   to   be   said   for   preserving   a   work   in   its   original   form   ,   warts   and   all   .   I   <br> </br>
   have   thus   followed   a   very   conservative   policy   of   correction   for   the   present   printing   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Obvious   printing   errors   have   been   corrected   ,   and   slight   changes   have   been   made   to   make   various   sentences   or   formulations   clearer   .   l   A   good   indication   of   <br> </br>
   my   conservative   policy   is   in   fOltnote   56   .   In   that   footnote   the   letter-nomenclature   for   the   yarious   objects   involved   ,   inexplicably   garbled   in   the   <br> </br>
   original   printing   ,   has   been   corrected   but   I   make   no   mention   ofthe   fact   that   the   argument   of   the   footnote   now   seems   to   me   to   have   problems   which   I   did   not   know   <br> </br>
   when   I   wrote   it   and   which   at   least   require   further   discussion.2   The   same   considerations   lead   me   to   give   up   any   serious   attempt   to   use   this   preface   to   amplify   <br> </br>
   my   previous   argument   ,   to   flU   in   lacunae   ,   or   to   deal   with   serious   criticisms   or   difficulties   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   1   I   thank   Margaret   Gilbert   for   her   valuable   help   in   this   editing   .   I   Although   I   have   not   had   time   for   careful   study   of   Nathan   Salmons   criti-   cism   <br> </br>
   Uoumalo.fPhilosophy   (   1979   )   ,   pp   .   703   -   25   )   of   this   footnote   ,   it   seems   likely   that   his   criticism   of   the   argument   ,   though   related   to   mine   ,   is   not   the   same   and   <br> </br>
   reconstructs   it   in   a   way   that   does   not   correspond   to   my   exact   intent   and   makes   the   argument   wmecessarily   weak   .   Also   ,   I   think   I   had   no   ambition   in   this   short   <br> </br>
   footnote   rigorously   to   prove   essentialism   from   the   theory   of   reference   alone   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   footnote   was   so   compressed   that   readers   might   easily   reconstruct   the   details   in   differing   ways   .   Obviously   ,   aside   from   such   amplification   in   the   <br> </br>
   preface   ,   there   are   passages   in   the   monograph   other   than   just   footnote   56   that   I   might   modify   .   I   do   stand   by   the   principal   theses   of   my   work   ,   and   the   pressure   <br> </br>
   for   much   revision   is   not   intense   .   I   will   ,   however   ,   use   this   preface   briefly   to   describe   the   background   and   genesis   of   the   leading   ideas   of   this   monograph   ,   <br> </br>
   and   to   discuss   a   few   misapprehensions   that   seem   to   be   common   .   I   am   afraid   that   I   must   disappoint   those   readers   who   already   found   the   exposition   in   the   <br> </br>
   monograph   satisfactory   on   these   points   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Relatively   little   will   be   added   to   deal   with   what   I   see   as   the   more   substantive   problems   of   the   monograph   .   The   issues   explained   further-mostly   related   to   <br> </br>
   modality   and   rigid   designation-may   already   have   been   clear   to   most   readers   .   On   the   other   hand   ,   those   readers   who   felt   sympathetic   to   some   of   the   <br> </br>
   objections   mentioned   here   may   well   be   justified   in   wishing   for   a   more   thorough   treatment   .   I   fear   that   in   most   cases   ,   the   treatment   ofdisputed   points   <br> </br>
   allowable   in   the   space   of   a   preface   is   simply   too   short   to   convince   many   readers   who   were   inclined   to   believe   the   objections   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   some   extent   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> brief   treatments   of   objections </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> may   do   more   harm </span>  than  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> good </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ,   since   the   reader   who   was   confused   may   think   that   if   this   is   all   that   can   be   replied   , </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> the   original   objection   must   have   been   cogent </span>  .   Nevertheless   ,   I   thought   I   should   register   briefly   why   I   think   certain   reactions   are   misconceived   .   I   hope   <br> </br>
   that   in   some   cases   I   will   be   able   to   write   at   greater   length   .   Here   I   must   plead   that   a   thorough   discussion   is   impossible   within   the   bounds   of   this   preface   .   <br> </br>
   Readers   who   are   new   to   this   book   can   use   the   preface   for   further   clarification   ofcertain   points   ,   and   for   a   briefhistory   of   their   genesis   .   I   would   recommend   <br> </br>
   that   such   readers   not   read   Thus   some   published   criticisms   are   not   discussed   here   because   they   are   10   frivolous   that   I   hope   they   are   not   given   wide   credence   <br> </br>
   othen   because   they   are   too   substantive   and   yet   other.-   simply   for   lack   of   space   .   I   leave   it   to   the   reader   to   decide   which   category   subsumes   any   panicular   <br> </br>
   example   .   F   the   preface   first   ,   but   that   they   return   to   it   for   clarification   (   if   necessary   )   after   they   have   read   the   main   text   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   preface   is   not   written   in   such   a   way   as   to   be   completely   self-contained   .   The   ideas   in   Naming   and   Necessity   evolved   in   the   early   sixties   -most   of   the   views   <br> </br>
   were   formulated   in   about   1963   -   64   .   Of   course   the   work   grew   out   ofearlier   formal   work   in   the   model   theory   ofmodal   logic   .   Already   when   I   worked   on   modal   logic   <br> </br>
   it   had   seemed   to   me   ,   as   Wiggins   has   said   ,   that   the   Leibnitzian   principle   of   the   indiscernibility   of   identicals4   was   as   selfevident   as   the   law   of   <br> </br>
   contradiction   .   That   some   philosophers   could   have   doubted   it   always   seemed   to   me   bizarre   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   model   theoretic   study   of   modal   logic   (   possible   worlds   semantics   )   could   only   confirm   this   conviction-the   alleged   counterexamples   involving   modal   <br> </br>
   properties   always   turned   out   to   turn   on   some   confusion   :   the   contexts   involved   did   not   express   genuine   properties   ,   scopes   were   confused   ,   or   coincidence   <br> </br>
   between   individual   concepts   was   confused   with   identity   between   individuals   .   The   model   theory   made   this   completely   clear   ,   though   it   should   have   been   <br> </br>
   clear   enough   on   the   intuitive   level   .   Waiving   fussy   considerations   deriving   from   the   fact   that   x   need   not   have   necessary   existence   ,   it   was   clear   from   (   x   )   0   (   <br> </br>
   x   x   )   and   Leibnitzs   law   that   identity   is   an   internal   relation   :   (   x   )   (   y   )   (   x   y   :   :   :   :   0   X   y   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   What   pairs   (   x   ,   y   )   could   be   counterexamples   ?   Not   pairs   ofdistinct   objects   ,   for   then   the   antecedent   is   false   nor   any   pair   of   an   object   and   itselr   :   for   then   <br> </br>
   the   consequent   is   true   .   )   If   a   and   b   are   rigid   desigators   ,   it   follows   that   a   b   ,   if   true   ,   is   a   necessary   truth   .   If   a   and   b   are   not   rigid   designators   ,   no   such   <br> </br>
   conclusion   follows   about   the   statement   a   b   (   though   the   objects   designated   by   a   and   b   will   be   necessarily   identical   )   .   In   speaking   of   rigid   designators   ,   we   <br> </br>
   are   speaking   of   a   I   The   principle   that   identicals   have   all   prop(rties   in   common   schematically   ,   (   x   )   (   y   )   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   x   y   Fx   .   :   :   :   .   Fy   )   .   Not   to   be   confused   with   the   identity   of   indiscernibles   .   ---   4   NAMING   AND   NECESSITY   NAMING   AND   NECESSITY   s   possbility   that   certainly   <br> </br>
   exists   in   a   formal   modal   language   .   LogIcally   ,   we   as   yet   are   committed   to   no   thesis   about   the   status   of   what   we   ordinarily   call   names   in   natural   language   .   We   <br> </br>
   must   distinguish   three   distinct   theses   :   (   i   )   that   identical   objects   are   necessarily   identical   (   ii   )   that   true   identity   statements   between   rigid   <br> </br>
   designators   are   necessary   (   iii   )   that   identity   statements   between   what   we   call   names   in   actual   language   are   necessary   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   (   i   )   and   (   ii   )   are   (   self-evident   )   theses   of   philosophical   logic   independent   of   natural   language   .   They   are   related   to   each   other   ,   though   (   i   )   is   about   <br> </br>
   objects   and   (   ii   )   is   metalinguistic   .   (   (   ii   )   rougWy   follows   from   (   i   )   ,   using   substitution   of   rigid   designators   for   universal   quantifiers-I   say   roughly   <br> </br>
   because   delicate   distinctions   about   rigidity   are   relevant   ,   see   page   21n   .   21   the   analogous   deduction   for   nonrigid   designators   is   fallacious   .   )   From   (   ii   )   <br> </br>
   all   that   strictly   follows   about   so-called   names   in   natural   language   is   that   either   they   are   not   rigid   or   true   identities   between   them   are   necessary   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Our   intuitive   idea   of   naming   suggests   that   names   are   rigid   ,   but   I   suppose   that   at   one   time   I   vaguely   supposed   ,   influenced   by   prevailing   presuppositions   ,   <br> </br>
   that   since   obviously   there   are   contingent   identities   between   ordinary   so-called   names   ,   such   ordinary   names   must   not   be   rigid   .   However   ,   it   was   already   <br> </br>
   clear   from   (i)-without   any   investigation   of   natural   language-that   the   supposition   ,   common   to   philosophical   discussions   of   materialism   at   that   time   ,   <br> </br>
   that   objects   can   be   contingently   identical   ,   is   false   .   Identity   would   be   an   internal   relation   even   if   natural   language   had   contained   no   rigid   designators   <br> </br>
   .   The   confused   reference   to   objects   as   contingently   identical   served   illegitimately   as   a   philosophical   crutch   :   It   enabled   philosophers   <br> </br>
   simultaneously   to   think   ofcertain   designators   as   if   they   were   non-rigid   (   and   hence   found   in   contingent   identities   )   and   as   if   they   were   rigid   ,   the   <br> </br>
   conflict   being   muddled   over   by   thinking   of   the   corresponding   objects   as   contingently   identical   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Even   before   I   clearly   realized   the   true   situation   regarding   proper   names   ,   I   felt   little   sympathy   for   the   dark   doctrine   of   a   relation   of   contingent   <br> </br>
   identity   .   Uniquely   identifying   properties   can   coincide   contingently   ,   but   objects   can   not   be   contingently   identical   .   Eventually   I   came   to   <br> </br>
   realize-this   realization   inaugurated   the   aforementioned   work   of   1963   -   64-that   the   received   presuppositions   against   the   necessity   ofidentities   <br> </br>
   between   ordinary   names   were   incorrect   ,   that   the   natural   intuition   that   the   names   ofordinary   language   are   rigid   designators   can   in   fact   be   upheld.1i   Part   <br> </br>
   of   the   effort   to   make   this   clear   involved   the   distinction   between   using   a   description   to   give   a   meaning   and   using   it   to   fix   a   reference   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   at   this   stage   I   rejected   the   conventional   description   theory   as   an   account   of   meaning   ,   though   its   validity   as   an   account   of   the   fixing   of   a   reference   <br> </br>
   was   left   untouched   .   Probably   I   let   myself   be   content   with   this   position   momentarily   ,   but   the   natural   next   step   was   to   question   whether   the   description   <br> </br>
   theory   gave   a   correct   account   even   of   how   the   references   ofnames   were   fixed   .   The   result   appears   in   the   second   of   these   lectures   .   It   was   a   short   step   to   <br> </br>
   realize   that   similar   remarks   applied   to   terms   for   natural   kinds   .   The   other   leading   ideas   came   naturally   as   things   fit   into   place   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Let   me   not   pay   inadequate   tribute   to   the   power   of   the   then   prevailing   complex   of   ideas   ,   emanating   from   Frege   and   from   Russell   ,   that   I   then   abandoned   .   The   <br> </br>
   natural   and   uniform   manner   by   which   these   ideas   appear   to   account   for   a   variety   of   philosophical   problems-their   marvelous   internal   coherenceis   <br> </br>
   adequate   explanation   for   their   long   appeal   .   I   myselfhave   been   shocked   at   the   prevalence   of   some   ideas   in   the   philosophical   community   which   to   me   have   <br> </br>
   little   or   no   appeal   ,   but   I   have   never   placed   the   description   theory   of   proper   names   in   such   a   category   .   Although   I   ,   with   others   ,   always   felt   some   strain   in   <br> </br>
   this   edifice   ,   it   took   some   time   to   get   free   ofits   seductive   power   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   6   It   also   became   clear   that  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> a   symbol   of   any   actual   or   hypothetical   language </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> that   is   not   a   rigid   designator   is   so   unlike   the   names   of   ordinary   language   that   it </span>  <br> </br>
  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> ought   not   to   be   called   a   name </span>  .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   particular   ,  <span class="subject level1 subject1"> this </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> would   apply   to   a   hypothetical   abbreviation   of   a   nonrigid   definite   description </span>  .   <br> </br>

   A   proper   understanding   of   this   statement   involves   an   understanding   both   of   the   (   extensionally   correct   )   conditions   under   which   it   is   in   fact   true   ,   and   of   <br> </br>
   the   conditions   under   which   a   ounterfactual   course   of   history   ,   resembling   the   actual   course   In   some   respects   but   not   in   others   ,   would   be   correctly   (   <br> </br>
   partially   )   described   by   (   I   )   .   Presumably   everyone   agrees   that   there   is   a   certain   man-the   philosopher   we   call   Aristotle-such   that   ,   as   a   matter   of   fact   ,   (   I   )   <br> </br>
   is   true   if   and   only   if   he   was   fond   of   dogs.s   The   thesis   of   rigid   designation   is   simply-subtle   points   aside1-that   the   same   paradigm   applies   to   the   truth   <br> </br>
   conditions   of(I   )   as   it   describes   counterfactual   situations   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   That   is   ,   (   I   )   truly   describes   a   counterfactual   situation   if   and   only   if   the   same   aforementioned   man   would   have   been   fond   of   dogs   ,   had   that   situation   <br> </br>
   obtained   .   (   Forget   the   counterfactual   situations   where   he   would   not   have   existed   .   )   By   contrast   ,   Russell   thinks   that   (   I   )   should   be   analyzed   as   something   <br> </br>
   like:8   That   is   everyone   ,   even   Russell   ,   would   agree   that   this   is   a   true   material   equivalence   ,   given   that   there   really   was   an   Aristotle   .   7   In   particular   ,   we   <br> </br>
   ignore   the   question   what   to   say   about   counterfactual   situations   in   which   Aristotle   would   not   have   existed   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   See   page   21   note   21   .   Taking   the   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   to   be   the   description   Russell   associates   with   Aristotle   .   Let   admirers   of   Epicureanism   <br> </br>
   ,   Stoicism   ,   etc   .   ,   not   be   offended   if   any   reader   thinks   that   someone   later   than   Aristotle   is   the   true   referent   ofthe   description   given   ,   let   that   reader   <br> </br>
   substitute   another   one   .   I   assume   Russell   is   .   right   in   that   defmite   descriptions   can   at   least   sometimes   be   interpreted   nonrigidly   .   As   I   mention   on   page   59   <br> </br>
   footnote   22   ,   some   philosophers   think   that   ,   in   addition   ,   there   is   a   rigid   sense   of   defmite   descriptions   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   I   say   in   the   latter   footnote   ,   I   am   not   convinced   of   this   ,   but   if   these   philosophers   are   right   ,   my   principal   thesis   is   not   affected   .   It   contrasts   names   with   <br> </br>
   nonrigid   descriptions   ,   as   advocated   by   Russell   .   See   Section   2   ,   pp   .   251   of   my   paper   ,   Speakers   Reference   and   Semantic   Reference   ,   Midwest   Studies   i   <br> </br>
   Philosophy   ,   II   (   1977   )   ,   pp   .   255   -   76   also   in   Contemporary   Perspectives   in   the   Philosophy   oflAnguage   ,   edited   by   Peter   A.   French   ,   Theodore   E.   Uehling   ,   aL   _   (   2   <br> </br>
   )   The   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   was   fond   of   dogs   ,   and   that   this   in   turn   should   be   analyzed   as   (   3   )   Exactly   one   person   was   last   among   the   great   philo-   <br> </br>
   sophers   of   antiquity   ,   and   any   such   person   was   fond   of   dogs   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   The   actual   truth   conditions   of(3   )   agree   extensionally   with   those   mentioned   above   for   (   I   )   ,   assuming   that   Aristotle   was   the   last   great   philosopher   of   <br> </br>
   antiquity   .   But   counterfactually   ,   Russells   conditions   can   vary   wildly   from   those   supposed   by   the   rigidity   thesis   .   With   respect   to   a   counterfactual   <br> </br>
   situation   where   someone   other   than   Aristotle   would   have   been   the   last   great   philosopher   of   antiquity   ,   Russells   criterion   would   make   that   other   persons   <br> </br>
   fondness   for   dogs   the   relevant   issue   for   the   correctness   Of(I   )   !   So   far   I   have   said   nothing   that   I   did   not   think   I   had   made   clear   before   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   it   should   be   apparent   from   the   explanation   that   some   criticisms   are   misunderstandings   .   Some   have   thought   that   the   simple   fact   that   two   people   can   have   <br> </br>
   the   same   name   refutes   the   rigidity   thesis   .   It   is   true   that   in   the   present   monograph   I   spoke   for   simplicity   as   if   each   name   had   a   unique   bearer   .   I   do   not   in   fact   <br> </br>
   think   ,   as   far   as   the   issue   of   rigidity   is   concerned   ,   that   this   is   a   major   oversimplification   .   I   believe   that   many   important   theoretical   issues   about   the   <br> </br>
   semantics   of   names   (   probably   not   all   )   would   be   largely   unaffected   had   our   conventions   required   that   no   two   things   shall   be   given   the   same   name   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   particular   ,   as   I   shall   explain   ,   the   issue   of   rigidity   would   be   unaffected   .   For   language   as   we   have   it   ,   we   could   speak   of   names   as   having   a   unique   referent   <br> </br>
   if   we   adopted   a   terminology   ,   anal-   Jr.   ,   and   Howard   K.   Wettstein   ,   University   of   Minnesota   Press   ,   Minneapolis   (   1979   )   ,   pp   .   6   -   27   )   for   a   brief   discussion   of   <br> </br>
   the   relation   of   the   idea   of   rigid   defmite   descriptions   to   Donnellans   referential   descriptions   .   I   also   discuss   the   relation   of   both   of   these   to   the   notion   <br> </br>
   of   scope   .   I   Actually   ,   the   criterion   should   be   subtler   ,   and   depends   on   ones   theoretical   views   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Thus   ,   on   the   picture   advocated   in   this   monograph   ,   two   totally   distinct   historical   chains   that   by   sheer   accident   assign   phonetically   the   same   name   to   the   <br> </br>
   same   man   should   probably   count   as   creating   distinct   names   despite   the   identity   of   the   referents   .   The   identity   may   well   be   unknown   to   the   speaker   ,   or   <br> </br>
   express   a   recent   discovery   .   (   Similarly   ,   a   description   theorist   who   counts   names   in   the   way   suggested   presumably   would   regard   two   phonetically   <br> </br>
   identical   names   with   distinct   associated   descriptions   as   distinct   ,   even   if   the   two   descriptions   happen   uniquely   to   be   true   of   the   same   object   .   )   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   But   distinctness   of   the   referents   will   be   a   s!fficienl   condition   for   distinctness   of   the   names   .   I   should   stress   that   I   am   not   demanding   or   even   advocating   <br> </br>
   this   usage   ,   but   mention   it   as   a   possibility   to   which   I   am   sympathetic   .   The   point   that   rigidity   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   question   of   two   people   having   <br> </br>
   phonetically   the   same   name   holds   whether   this   convention   is   adopted   or   not   .   10   Eut   perhaps   one   use   of   How   many   names   are   there   in   this   telephone   book   ?   is   an   <br> </br>
   exception   (   Anne   Jacobson   )   .   11   Ey   using   this   term   ,   I   do   not   mean   to   commie   the   analysis   to   a   particular   view   (   see   also   the   next   footnote   )   ,   though   I   suggest   my   <br> </br>
   own   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   I   mean   simply   that   two   people   can   have   phonetically   the   same   name   .   ogous   to   the   practice   of   calling   homonyms   distinct   words   ,   according   to   which   uses   of   <br> </br>
   phonetically   the   same   sOWlds   to   nam   :   distinct   objects   count   as   distinct   names.8   This   terminology   cert.aml   !   does   not   agree   with   the   most   common   usage,10   <br> </br>
   but   I   thmk   It   may   have   a   great   deal   to   recommend   it   for   theoretical   purposes   .   But   the   main   point   is   that   ,   however   a   philosophical   theory   may   treat   such   <br> </br>
   homonymousll   names   ,   the   issue   is   irrelevant   to   the   question   of   rigidity   .   As   a   speaker   ofmy   idiolect   ,   I   call   only   ne   oject   Aristotle   ,   though   I   am   aware   that   <br> </br>
   other   people   ,   mcludmg   the   man   I   call   Onassis   or   perhaps   AristotleOnassis   ,   had   the   same   given   name   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Other   readers   may   use   Aristotle   to   name   more   than   one   object   (   person   ,   or   pet   animal   )   and   for   them   (   I   )   has   no   unambiguous   truth   conditions   .   When   I   spoke   of   the   <br> </br>
   truth   conditions   of   (   I   )   ,   I   perforce   assum   .   d   a   particular   reading   for   (   I   )   .   (   So   of   course   ,   does   the   classical   description   theorist   this   is   not   an   issue   <br> </br>
   between   us   .   Classical   description   theorists   ,   too   ,   tended   to   speak   for   simplicity   as   if   names   had   Wlique   references   .   )   In   practice   it   is   usual   to   suppose   <br> </br>
   that   what   is   meant   in   a   particular   use   of   a   sentence   is   understood   from   the   context   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   In   the   present   instance   ,   that   context   made   it   clear   that   it   was   the   conventional   use   of   Aristotle   for   the   great   philosopher   that   was   in   question   .   Then   ,   <br> </br>
   given   this   fixed   understanding   of   (   I   )   ,   the   question   of   rigidity   is   :   Is   the   correctness   of   (   I   )   ,   thus   understood   ,   determined   with   respect   to   each   <br> </br>
   counterfactual   situation   by   whether   a   certain   single   person   would   have   liked   dogs   (   had   that   situation   obtained   )   ?   I   answer   the   question   affirmatively   .   <br> </br>
   But   Russell   seems   to   be   committed   to   the   opposite   view   ,   even   when   what   (   I   )   expresses   is   fixed   by   the   context   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Only   given   such   a   fixed   understanding   of   (   I   )   would   Russell   read   (   I   )   as   (3)-not   if   Aristotle   meant   Onassis   !   -but   the   rigidity   requirement   is   violated   .   This   <br> </br>
   question   is   entirely   unaffected   by   the   presence   or   absence   in   the   language   of   other   readings   of   (   I   )   .   For   each   such   particular   reading   separately   ,   we   can   <br> </br>
   ask   whether   what   is   expressed   would   be   true   of   a   counterfactual   situation   if   and   only   if   some   fixed   individual   has   the   appropriate   property   .   This   is   the   <br> </br>
   question   of   rigidity   .   Let   me   recapitulate   the   point   ,   ignoring   for   this   exposition   the   delicate   problems   about   propositions   to   be   mentioned   at   the   end   of   <br> </br>
   this   preface   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   To   speak   of   the   truth   conditions   of   a   sentence   such   as   (   I   )   ,   it   must   be   taken   to   express   a   single   proposition-otherwise   its   truth   conditions   even   with   <br> </br>
   respect   to   the   actual   world   arc   indeterminate   .
