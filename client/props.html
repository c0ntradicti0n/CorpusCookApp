 Review   of   Logical   Foundations   of   Artificial   Intelligence   Book   Reviews   BookReviews   Automated   Reasoning   :   Thirty-Three   Basic   Research   Problems   The   <br> </br>
   discussion   of   the   obstacles   in   Chapter   2   is   relaxing   ;   although   some   repetition   exists   in   the   book   ,   the   author   spares   you   a   puffy   pseudophilosophical   <br> </br>
   treatise   on   AI   in   general   and   AR   specifically   .   After   reading   this   chapter   ,   you   are   convinced   there   is   no   general   problem   solver   ,   and   you   have   a   pleasant   <br> </br>
   introduction   to   the   belly   of   the   beast   .  <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> A </span> <span class="subject level1 subject1"> non-expert </span> <span class="contrast level1 contrast1"> might   have   some   problems   in   mapping   the   eight   obstacles   described   to   the   problems   and   problem   areas </span>  <br> </br>

   However   ,   the   detailed   discussion   that   forms   the   heart   of   the   book   provides   the   reader   with   ample   reward   .   It   is   clear   that   the   author   writes   with   a   freshness   <br> </br>
   and   an   obvious   love   for   logic   .   The   book   as   a   whole   is   a   rarity   in   that   it   successfully   serves   several   audiences   at   the   same   time   .   The   layperson   gets   a   real   <br> </br>

   .   Those   who   Book   Reviews   study   declarative   knowledge   representations   are   divided   about   whether   such   notations   ought   to   be   thought   of   as   variants   of   the   <br> </br>
   predicate   calculus   and   related   systems   of   mathematical   logic   invented   by   logicians   ,   mathematicians   ,   and   philosophers   in   this   century   .   Lately   ,   those   <br> </br>
   who   think   they   ought   to   be   so   regarded   seem   to   be   winning   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   have   no   doubt   and   take   it   for   granted   that   the   semantic   tools   of   mathematical   logic   are   indispensable   for   analyzing   knowledge   <br> </br>
   representations   .   They   adopt   the   label   Iogicism   for   this   doctrine   .   When   they   reach   the   topic   of   inference   ,   however   ,   they   seem   to   lose   their   way   .   Chapters   3   <br> </br>
   through   5   are   concerned   with   this   topic   ,   but   it   is   central   to   the   entire   book   .   Inference   can   be   considered   as   the   deriving   of   probably   useful   ,   probably   <br> </br>
   correct   conclusions   from   a   set   of   beliefs   .   This   characterization   is   vague   ,   but   the   vagueness   is   inevitable   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   Almost   any   algorithm   can   be   thought   of   as   doing   inference   in   some   sense   ,   and   if   we   arrange   that   its   premises   and   conclusions   are   expressed   in   a   logical   <br> </br>
   notation   (   not   a   difficult   requirement   )   ,   then   it   can   be   thought   of   as   doing   inference   on   a   declarative   knowledge   representation   .   The   authors   give   several   <br> </br>
   examples   throughout   the   book   .   Chapter   7   ,   for   instance   ,   is   devoted   to   In   competition   with   this   diversity   is   the   idea   of   a   unified   model   of   inference   .   The   <br> </br>
   desire   for   such   a   model   is   strong   among   those   who   study   declarative   representations   ,   and   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   are   no   exception   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   As   are   most   of   their   colleagues   ,   they   are   drawn   to   the   model   of   inference   as   the   derivation   of   conclusions   that   are   entailed   by   a   set   of   beliefs   .   They   wander   <br> </br>
   from   this   idea   in   a   few   places   but   not   for   long   .   It   is   not   hard   to   see   why   :   Deduction   is   one   of   the   fews   kinds   of   inference   for   which   we   have   an   interesting   <br> </br>
   general   theory   .   It   ’s   clear   what   the   authors   are   thinking   .   They   are   studying   foundations   ;   so   ,   what   ’s   important   is   what   should   be   inferred   in   a   situation   ,   <br> </br>
   not   what   actually   can   be   practically   inferred   (   compared   ,   say   ,   to   theoretical   mechanics   )   .   <br> </br>
   <br> </br>
   However   ,   as   I   argued   earlier   ,   what   should   be   inferred   is   probably   different   from   what   is   entailed   by   current   beliefs   because   not   all   that   is   entailed   is   <br> </br>
   useful   and   not   all   that   is   probably   correct   is   entailed   .   The   authors   are   forced   to   acknowledge   these   discrepancies   in   their   detours   to   alternative   <br> </br>
   inference   techniques   in   Chapters   6   ,   7   ,   and   8   ,   but   their   heart   is   n’t   in   it   .   When   it   comes   to   actual   applications   ,   they   always   revert   to   classical   deduction   .   <br> </br>
   The   unsophisticated   reader   should   be   warned   that   the   foundations   being   explored   are   not   exactly   the   foundations   of   AI   .   <br> </br>

   .   Perhaps   Genesereth   and   Nilsson   feel   that   techniques   for   solving   planning   problems   will   come   and   go   ,   but   the   foundations   can   be   secure   .   If   so   ,   they   are   too   <br> </br>
   casual   about   the   implicit   claim   .   I   admit   to   bias   on   these   questions   .   My   skepticism   should   be   balanced   by   the   agreement   of   many   perfectly   reasonable   people   <br> </br>

   which   augments   a   standard   theory   with   a   special   axiom   schema   that   can   change   nonmonotonically   as   new   beliefs   are   added   .   This   description   of   <br> </br>
